Using GNU autoconfig
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1.	If you retrieved a CVS version of this package, you need the GNU
	autoconf package to generate the configure script.  This is done
	by running   ./.prebuild   in this directory which will automatically
	run autoconf with the appropriate options.

  2.	Run   ./configure   to generate config.h and the various Makefiles.
	./configure --help   gives a list of possible options with slightly
	longer descriptions in README.configure

	Note that configure options have changed since 2.6.x series.

	Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that
	the `configure' script does not know about.  You can give `configure'
	initial values for variables by setting them in the environment.  Using
	a Bourne-compatible shell, you can do that on the command line like
	this:
	        CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix ./configure
	Or on systems that have the `env' program, you can do it like this:
		env CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS=-s ./configure
	Or if you're using a non Bourne-compatible shell, you can do:
		sh -c 'CFLAGS="-O2 -g" ./configure

	If you are making different versions of rxvt you can configure them
	to be installed with different names using configure arguments, e.g.
	./configure --enable-languages --program-transform-name='s,rxvt,kxvt,;'

  3.	set any other main preferences:
    	    Edit "src/feature.h"
	    Edit "config.h"   if you didn't use ./configure options
	    If you're cross-compiling, edit the following in "config.h"
		NO_XLOCALE
		SIZEOF_*	# sizeof some types

  4.	Build it (repeat step 2 as desired):
	    make

  5.	build rclock (small xclock with biff & appointments) and
	optionally edit rclock/feature.h to add/remove features:
	    make clock

  6. 	Install both rxvt and rclock:
	    make install

	or install them separately
	    (cd src; make install)
	    (cd rclock; make install)

	you may also want to install doc/etc/rxvt.terminfo and 
	doc/etc/rxvt.termcap

  7 a.	If compiled with UTMP_SUPPORT, you may need to install rxvt setuid
	root or setuid/setgid to match the file permissions on /etc/utmp
  7 b.  You may need to install setuid root anyway for some systems so that
	they can give you ownership of the tty devices.

  8.	On systems which dislike doc/rxvt.1
	    (cd doc; rm rxvt.1; make rxvt.1)

		 ===================================

NB:	If you were able to compile OK but running rxvt prints out
		"rxvt: could not obtain control of tty"
	running "make tests" from this directory (or from src/test)
	should give you a breakdown of the failure point which is
	useful to the developers in fixing the problem

NB:	SunOS (with/without gcc?) gets reported by configure as

		#undef STDC_HEADERS
		#define HAVE_SYS_IOCTL_H 1

	but the ioctl() defines aren't protected against multiple
	inclusion, in this case by <termios.h> so use a hack in
	"feature.h" to avoid the problem.

	Gave up checking for `STDC_HEADERS', since they really should be
	there and I don't want to deal with the problems when they don't
	exist.

	SunOS users might complain to the right places and get their
	system headers fixed so that one day the rest of us won't have
	to keep compensating :(

	SVR4 users (that aren't using gcc) will have to add -DSVR4 to
	CPPFLAGS for configure.
