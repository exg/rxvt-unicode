Description:	@RXVT_WEBPAGE@
		Rxvt is an 8-bit clean, colour xterm replacement that uses
		significantly less memory than a conventional xterm, mostly
		since it doesn't support toolkit configurability or Tek
		graphics, but also since features can be removed at
		compile-time to reflect your needs.  Some rxvt features
		(compilation dependent): ANSI-color, bold/blink attributes
		modify foreground/background colours, scrollbars with arrow
		buttons, kanji and greek support, printer-pipe, XPM
		backgrounds with on-the-fly scaling, user-definable menus.

		The distribution also includes rclock, the smaller/better
		xclock replacement with appointment scheduling and xbiff
		functionality.
