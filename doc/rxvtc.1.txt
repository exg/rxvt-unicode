NAME
    urxvtc - control the urxvtd daemon

SYNOPSIS
    urxvtc [same options as for urxvt]

DESCRIPTION
    This manpage describes the urxvtc client program. It connects to the
    urxvtd daemon and requests a new terminal window. It takes the same
    arguments as the urxvt program. The environment will also be respected.
    Currently, it always returns immediately after contacting the daemon.

OPTIONS
    All options that are valid for urxvt are valid for urxvtc, too. Please
    note that all options are currently interpreted in the context of the
    daemon process, which makes a difference for options that specify a file
    descriptor (such as -pty-fd).

EXIT STATUS
    If everything went well, urxvtc returns with an exit status of 0. If
    contacting the daemon fails, it exits with the exit status 2. In all
    other error cases it returns with status 1.

    This can be used to implement auto-starting behaviour, by checking for
    an exit status of 2, running "urxvtd -f -q" and retrying the call to
    urxvtc.

ENVIRONMENT
    All environment variables of the current process will be made available
    to the new instance, and will be interpreted as if urxvt were started
    directly.

    RXVT_SOCKET
        Both urxvtc and urxvtd use the environment variable RXVT_SOCKET to
        create a listening socket and to contact the urxvtd, respectively.
        If the variable is missing, $HOME/.rxvt-unicode-*<nodename>* is
        used. The variable must specify the absolute path of the socket to
        create.
