NAME
    rxvt-unicode (ouR XVT, unicode) - (a VT102 emulator for the X window
    system)

SYNOPSIS
    rxvt [options] [-e command [ args ]]

DESCRIPTION
    rxvt-unicode, version 7.0, is a colour vt102 terminal emulator intended
    as an *xterm*(1) replacement for users who do not require features such
    as Tektronix 4014 emulation and toolkit-style configurability. As a
    result, rxvt-unicode uses much less swap space -- a significant
    advantage on a machine serving many X sessions.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
    See rxvt(7) (try "man 7 rxvt") for a list of frequently asked questions
    and answer to them and some common problems. That document is also
    accessible on the World-Wide-Web at
    <http://cvs.schmorp.de/browse/*checkout*/rxvt-unicode/doc/rxvt.7.html>.

RXVT-UNICODE VS. RXVT
    Unlike the original rxvt, rxvt-unicode stores all text in Unicode
    internally. That means it can store and display most scripts in the
    world. Being a terminal emulator, however, some things are very
    difficult, especially cursive scripts such as arabic, vertically written
    scripts like mongolian or scripts requiring extremely complex combining
    rules, like tibetan or devenagari. Don't expect pretty output when using
    these scripts. Most other scripts, latin, cyrillic, kanji, thai etc.
    should work fine, though. A somewhat difficult case are left-to-right
    scripts, such as hebrew: rxvt-unicode adopts the view that bidirectional
    algorithms belong into the application, not the terminal emulator (too
    many things -- such as cursor-movement while editing -- break
    otherwise), but that might change.

    If you are looking for a terminal that supports more exotic scripts, let
    me recommend "mlterm", which is a very userfriendly, lean and clean
    terminal emulator. In fact, the reason rxvt-unicode was born was solely
    because the author couldn't get "mlterm" to use one font for latin1 and
    another for japanese.

    Therefore another design rationale was the use of multiple fonts to
    display characters: The idea of a single unicode font which many other
    programs force onto it's users never made sense to me: You should be
    able to choose any font for any script freely.

    Apart from that, rxvt-unicode is also much better internationalised than
    it's predecessor, supports things such as XFT and ISO 14755 that are
    handy in i18n-environments, is faster, and has a lot less bugs than the
    original rxvt. This all in addition to dozens of other small
    improvements.

    It is still faithfully following the original rxvt idea of being lean
    and nice on resources: for example, you can still configure rxvt-unicode
    without most of it's features to get a lean binary. It also comes with a
    client/daemon pair that lets you open any number of terminal windows
    from within a single process, which makes startup time very fast and
    drastically reduces memory usage. See rxvtd(1) (daemon) and rxvtc(1)
    (client).

    It also makes technical information about escape sequences (which have
    been extended) easier accessible: see rxvt(7) for technical reference
    documentation (escape sequences etc.).

OPTIONS
    The rxvt options (mostly a subset of *xterm*'s) are listed below. In
    keeping with the smaller-is-better philosophy, options may be eliminated
    or default values chosen at compile-time, so options and defaults listed
    may not accurately reflect the version installed on your system. `rxvt
    -h' gives a list of major compile-time options on the *Options* line.
    Option descriptions may be prefixed with which compile option each is
    dependent upon. e.g. `Compile *XIM*:' requires *XIM* on the *Options*
    line. Note: `rxvt -help' gives a list of all command-line options
    compiled into your version.

    Note that rxvt permits the resource name to be used as a long-option
    (--/++ option) so the potential command-line options are far greater
    than those listed. For example: `rxvt --loginShell --color1 Orange'.

    The following options are available:

    -help, --help
        Print out a message describing available options.

    -display *displayname*
        Attempt to open a window on the named X display (-d still
        respected). In the absence of this option, the display specified by
        the DISPLAY environment variable is used.

    -geometry *geom*
        Window geometry (-g still respected); resource geometry.

    -rv|+rv
        Turn on/off simulated reverse video; resource reverseVideo.

    -j|+j
        Turn on/off jump scrolling; resource jumpScroll.

    -ip|+ip | -tr|+tr
        Turn on/off inheriting parent window's pixmap. Alternative form is
        -tr; resource inheritPixmap.

    -fade *number*
        Fade the text by the given percentage when focus is lost. Small
        values fade a little only, 100 completely replaces all colours by
        the fade colour; resource fading.

    -fadecolor *colour*
        Fade to this colour when fading is used (see -fade). The default
        colour is black. resource fadeColor.

    -tint *colour*
        Tint the transparent background pixmap with the given colour when
        transparency is enabled with -tr or -ip. This only works for
        non-tiled backgrounds, currently. See also the -sh option that can
        be used to brighten or darken the image in addition to tinting it;
        resource *tintColor*. Example:

           rxvt -tr -tint blue -sh 40

    -sh *number* Darken (0 .. 100) or lighten (-1 .. -100) the transparent
        background image in addition to tinting it (i.e. -tint must be
        specified, too, e.g. "-tint white").

    -bg *colour*
        Window background colour; resource background.

    -fg *colour*
        Window foreground colour; resource foreground.

    -pixmap *file[;geom]*
        Compile *XPM*: Specify XPM file for the background and also
        optionally specify its scaling with a geometry string. Note you may
        need to add quotes to avoid special shell interpretation of the ";"
        in the command-line; resource backgroundPixmap.

    -cr *colour*
        The cursor colour; resource cursorColor.

    -pr *colour*
        The mouse pointer foreground colour; resource pointerColor.

    -pr2 *colour*
        The mouse pointer background colour; resource pointerColor2.

    -bd *colour*
        The colour of the border around the text area and between the
        scrollbar and the text; resource borderColor.

    -fn *fontlist*
        Select the fonts to be used. This is a comma separated list of font
        names that are used in turn when trying to display Unicode
        characters. The first font defines the cell size for characters;
        other fonts might be smaller, but not (in general) larger. A
        (hopefully) reasonable default font list is always appended to it.
        See resource font for more details.

        In short, to specify an X11 core font, just specify it's name or
        prefix it with "x:". To specify an XFT-font, you need to prefix it
        with "xft:", e.g.:

           rxvt -fn "xft:Bitstream Vera Sans Mono:pixelsize=15"
           rxvt -fn "9x15bold,xft:Bitstream Vera Sans Mono"

        See also the question "How does rxvt-unicode choose fonts?" in the
        FAQ section of rxvt(7).

    -fb *fontlist*
        Compile *font-styles*: The bold font list to use when bold
        characters are to be printed. See resource boldFont for details.

    -fi *fontlist*
        Compile *font-styles*: The italic font list to use when *italic*
        characters are to be printed. See resource italicFont for details.

    -fbi *fontlist*
        Compile *font-styles*: The bold italic font list to use when *bold
        italic* characters are to be printed. See resource boldItalicFont
        for details.

    -is|+is
        Compile *font-styles*: Bold/Italic font styles imply high intensity
        foreground/background (default). See resource intensityStyles for
        details.

    -name *name*
        Specify the application name under which resources are to be
        obtained, rather than the default executable file name. Name should
        not contain `.' or `*' characters. Also sets the icon and title
        name.

    -ls|+ls
        Start as a login-shell/sub-shell; resource loginShell.

    -ut|+ut
        Compile *utmp*: Inhibit/enable writing a utmp entry; resource
        utmpInhibit.

    -vb|+vb
        Turn on/off visual bell on receipt of a bell character; resource
        visualBell.

    -sb|+sb
        Turn on/off scrollbar; resource scrollBar.

    -si|+si
        Turn on/off scroll-to-bottom on TTY output inhibit; resource
        scrollTtyOutput has opposite effect.

    -sk|+sk
        Turn on/off scroll-to-bottom on keypress; resource
        scrollTtyKeypress.

    -sw|+sw
        Turn on/off scrolling with the scrollback buffer as new lines
        appear. This only takes effect if -si is also given; resource
        scrollWithBuffer.

    -sr|+sr
        Put scrollbar on right/left; resource scrollBar_right.

    -st|+st
        Display rxvt (non XTerm/NeXT) scrollbar without/with a trough;
        resource scrollBar_floating.

    -ptab|+ptab
        If enabled (default), "Horizontal Tab" characters are being stored
        as actual wide characters in the screen buffer, which makes it
        possible to select and paste them. Since a horizontal tab is a
        cursor movement and not an actual glyph, this can sometimes be
        visually annoying as the cursor on a tab character is displayed as a
        wide cursor; resource pastableTabs.

    -bc|+bc
        Blink the cursor; resource cursorBlink.

    -iconic
        Start iconified, if the window manager supports that option.
        Alternative form is -ic.

    -sl *number*
        Save *number* lines in the scrollback buffer. See resource entry for
        limits; resource saveLines.

    -b *number*
        Compile *frills*: Internal border of *number* pixels. See resource
        entry for limits; resource internalBorder.

    -w *number*
        Compile *frills*: External border of *number* pixels. Also, -bw and
        -borderwidth. See resource entry for limits; resource
        externalBorder.

    -bl Compile *frills*: Set MWM hints to request a borderless window, i.e.
        if honoured by the WM, the rxvt-unicode window will not have window
        decorations; resource borderLess.

    -sbg
        Compile *frills*: Disable the usage of the built-in block
        graphics/line drawing characters and just rely on what the specified
        fonts provide. Use this if you have a good font and want to use its
        block graphic glyphs; resource skipBuiltinGlyphs.

    -lsp *number*
        Compile *frills*: Lines (pixel height) to insert between each row of
        the display. Useful to work around font rendering problems; resource
        linespace.

    -tn *termname*
        This option specifies the name of the terminal type to be set in the
        TERM environment variable. This terminal type must exist in the
        *termcap(5)* database and should have *li#* and *co#* entries;
        resource termName.

    -e *command [arguments]*
        Run the command with its command-line arguments in the rxvt window;
        also sets the window title and icon name to be the basename of the
        program being executed if neither *-title* (*-T*) nor *-n* are given
        on the command line. If this option is used, it must be the last on
        the command-line. If there is no -e option then the default is to
        run the program specified by the SHELL environment variable or,
        failing that, *sh(1)*.

        Please note that you must specify a program with arguments. If you
        want to run shell commands, you have to specify the shell, like
        this:

          rxvt -e sh -c "shell commands"

    -title *text*
        Window title (-T still respected); the default title is the basename
        of the program specified after the -e option, if any, otherwise the
        application name; resource title.

    -n *text*
        Icon name; the default name is the basename of the program specified
        after the -e option, if any, otherwise the application name;
        resource iconName.

    -C  Capture system console messages.

    -pt *style*
        Compile *XIM*: input style for input method; OverTheSpot,
        OffTheSpot, Root; resource preeditType.

    -im *text*
        Compile *XIM*: input method name. resource inputMethod.

    -imlocale *string*
        The locale to use for opening the IM. You can use an "LC_CTYPE" of
        e.g. "de_DE.UTF-8" for normal text processing but "ja_JP.EUC-JP" for
        the input extension to be able to input japanese characters while
        staying in another locale. resource imLocale.

    -imfont *fontset*
        Set the font set to use for the X Input Method, see resource imFont
        for more info.

    -tcw
        Change the meaning of triple-click selection with the left mouse
        button. Instead of selecting a full line it will extend the
        selection the end of the logical line only. resource
        tripleclickwords.

    -insecure
        Enable "insecure" mode, which currently enables most of the escape
        sequences that echo strings. See the resource insecure for more
        info.

    -mod *modifier*
        Override detection of Meta modifier with specified key: alt, meta,
        hyper, super, mod1, mod2, mod3, mod4, mod5; resource *modifier*.

    -ssc|+ssc
        Turn on/off secondary screen (default enabled); resource
        secondaryScreen.

    -ssr|+ssr
        Turn on/off secondary screen scroll (default enabled); resource
        secondaryScroll.

    -hold|+hold
        Turn on/off hold window after exit support. If enabled, rxvt will
        not immediately destroy its window when the program executed within
        it exits. Instead, it will wait till it is being killed or closed by
        the user; resource hold.

    -keysym.*sym* *string*
        Remap a key symbol. See resource keysym.

    -embed *windowid*
        Tells rxvt to embed it's windows into an already-existing window,
        which enables applications to easily embed a terminal.

        Right now, rxvt will first unmap/map the specified window, so it
        shouldn't be a top-level window. rxvt will also reconfigure it quite
        a bit, so don't expect it to keep some specific state. It's best to
        create an extra subwindow for rxvt and leave it alone.

        The window will not be destroyed when rxvt exits.

        It might be useful to know that rxvt will not close file descriptors
        passed to it (except for stdin/out/err, of course), so you can use
        file descriptors to communicate with the programs within the
        terminal. This works regardless of wether the "-embed" option was
        used or not.

        Here is a short Gtk2-perl snippet that illustrates how this option
        can be used (a longer example is in doc/embed):

           my $rxvt = new Gtk2::Socket;
           $rxvt->signal_connect_after (realize => sub {
              my $xid = $_[0]->window->get_xid;
              system "rxvt -embed $xid &";
           });

    -pty-fd *file descriptor*
        Tells rxvt NOT to execute any commands or create a new pty/tty pair
        but instead use the given filehandle as the tty master. This is
        useful if you want to drive rxvt as a generic terminal emulator
        without having to run a program within it.

        If this switch is given, rxvt will not create any utmp/wtmp entries
        and will not tinker with pty/tty permissions - you have to do that
        yourself if you want that.

        As an extremely special case, specifying -1 will completely suppress
        pty/tty operations.

        Here is a example in perl that illustrates how this option can be
        used (a longer example is in doc/pty-fd):

           use IO::Pty;
           use Fcntl;

           my $pty = new IO::Pty;
           fcntl $pty, F_SETFD, 0; # clear close-on-exec
           system "rxvt -pty-fd " . (fileno $pty) . "&";
           close $pty;

           # now communicate with rxvt
           my $slave = $pty->slave;
           while (<$slave>) { print $slave "got <$_>\n" }

    -pe *string*
        Comma-separated list of perl extension scripts to use (or not to
        use) in this terminal instance. See resource perl-ext for details.

RESOURCES (available also as long-options)
    Note: `rxvt --help' gives a list of all resources (long options)
    compiled into your version.

    You can set and change the resources using X11 tools like xrdb. Many
    distribution do also load settings from the ~/.Xresources file when X
    starts. rxvt will consult the following files/resources in order, with
    later settings overwriting earlier ones:

      1. system-wide app-defaults file, either locale-dependent OR global
      2. app-defaults file in $XAPPLRESDIR
      3. RESOURCE_MANAGER property on root-window OR $HOME/.Xdefaults
      4. SCREEN_RESOURCES for the current screen
      5. $XENVIRONMENT file OR $HOME/.Xdefaults-<nodename>

    Note that when reading X resources, rxvt recognizes two class names:
    Rxvt and URxvt. The class name Rxvt allows resources common to both rxvt
    and the original *rxvt* to be easily configured, while the class name
    URxvt allows resources unique to rxvt, to be shared between different
    rxvt configurations. If no resources are specified, suitable defaults
    will be used. Command-line arguments can be used to override resource
    settings. The following resources are supported (you might want to check
    the rxvtperl(3) manpage for additional settings by perl extensions not
    documented here):

    geometry: *geom*
        Create the window with the specified X window geometry [default
        80x24]; option -geometry.

    background: *colour*
        Use the specified colour as the window's background colour [default
        White]; option -bg.

    foreground: *colour*
        Use the specified colour as the window's foreground colour [default
        Black]; option -fg.

    color*n*: *colour*
        Use the specified colour for the colour value *n*, where 0-7
        corresponds to low-intensity (normal) colours and 8-15 corresponds
        to high-intensity (bold = bright foreground, blink = bright
        background) colours. The canonical names are as follows: 0=black,
        1=red, 2=green, 3=yellow, 4=blue, 5=magenta, 6=cyan, 7=white, but
        the actual colour names used are listed in the COLORS AND GRAPHICS
        section.

        Colours higher than 15 cannot be set using resources (yet), but can
        be changed using an escape command (see rxvt(7)).

        Colours 16-79 form a standard 4x4x4 colour cube (the same as xterm
        with 88 colour support). Colours 80-87 are evenly spaces grey steps.

    colorBD: *colour*
    colorIT: *colour*
        Use the specified colour to display bold or italic characters when
        the foreground colour is the default. If font styles are not
        available (Compile *styles*) and this option is unset, reverse video
        is used instead.

    colorUL: *colour*
        Use the specified colour to display underlined characters when the
        foreground colour is the default.

    colorRV: *colour*
        Use the specified colour as the background for reverse video
        characters.

    underlineColor: *colour*
        If set, use the specified colour as the colour for the underline
        itself. If unset, use the foreground colour.

    cursorColor: *colour*
        Use the specified colour for the cursor. The default is to use the
        foreground colour; option -cr.

    cursorColor2: *colour*
        Use the specified colour for the colour of the cursor text. For this
        to take effect, cursorColor must also be specified. The default is
        to use the background colour.

    reverseVideo: *boolean*
        True: simulate reverse video by foreground and background colours;
        option -rv. False: regular screen colours [default]; option +rv. See
        note in COLORS AND GRAPHICS section.

    jumpScroll: *boolean*
        True: specify that jump scrolling should be used. When scrolling
        quickly, fewer screen updates are performed [default]; option -j.
        False: specify that smooth scrolling should be used; option +j.

    inheritPixmap: *boolean*
        True: make the background inherit the parent windows' pixmap, giving
        artificial transparency. False: do not inherit the parent windows'
        pixmap.

    fading: *number*
        Fade the text by the given percentage when focus is lost; option
        -fade.

    fadeColor: *colour*
        Fade to this colour, when fading is used (see fading:). The default
        colour is black; option -fadecolor.

    tintColor: *colour*
        Tint the transparent background pixmap with the given colour; option
        -tint.

    shading: *number*
        Darken (0 .. 100) or lighten (-1 .. -100) the transparent background
        image in addition to tinting it.

    scrollColor: *colour*
        Use the specified colour for the scrollbar [default #B2B2B2].

    troughColor: *colour*
        Use the specified colour for the scrollbar's trough area [default
        #969696]. Only relevant for rxvt (non XTerm/NeXT) scrollbar.

    borderColor: *colour*
        The colour of the border around the text area and between the
        scrollbar and the text.

    backgroundPixmap: *file[;geom]*
        Use the specified XPM file (note the `.xpm' extension is optional)
        for the background and also optionally specify its scaling with a
        geometry string WxH+X+Y, in which "W" / "H" specify the
        horizontal/vertical scale (percent) and "X" / "Y" locate the image
        centre (percent). A scale of 0 displays the image with tiling. A
        scale of 1 displays the image without any scaling. A scale of 2 to 9
        specifies an integer number of images in that direction. No image
        will be magnified beyond 10 times its original size. The maximum
        permitted scale is 1000. [default 0x0+50+50]

    menu: *file[;tag]*
        Read in the specified menu file (note the `.menu' extension is
        optional) and also optionally specify a starting tag to find. See
        the reference documentation for details on the syntax for the
        menuBar.

    path: *path*
        Specify the colon-delimited search path for finding files (XPM and
        menus), in addition to the paths specified by the RXVTPATH and PATH
        environment variables.

    font: *fontlist*
        Select the fonts to be used. This is a comma separated list of font
        names that are used in turn when trying to display Unicode
        characters. The first font defines the cell size for characters;
        other fonts might be smaller, but not larger. A reasonable default
        font list is always appended to it; option -fn.

        Each font can either be a standard X11 core font (XLFD) name, with
        optional prefix "x:" or a Xft font (Compile *xft*), prefixed with
        "xft:".

        In addition, each font can be prefixed with additional hints and
        specifications enclosed in square brackets ("[]"). The only
        available hint currently is "codeset=codeset-name", and this is only
        used for Xft fonts.

        For example, this font resource

           URxvt*font: 9x15bold,\
                       -misc-fixed-bold-r-normal--15-140-75-75-c-90-iso10646-1,\
                       -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--15-140-75-75-c-90-iso10646-1, \
                       [codeset=JISX0208]xft:Kochi Gothic:antialias=false, \
                       xft:Code2000:antialias=false

        specifies five fonts to be used. The first one is "9x15bold"
        (actually the iso8859-1 version of the second font), which is the
        base font (because it is named first) and thus defines the character
        cell grid to be 9 pixels wide and 15 pixels high.

        The second font is just used to add additional unicode characters
        not in the base font, likewise the third, which is unfortunately
        non-bold, but the bold version of the font does contain less
        characters, so this is a useful supplement.

        The third font is an Xft font with aliasing turned off, and the
        characters are limited to the JIS 0208 codeset (i.e. japanese
        kanji). The font contains other characters, but we are not
        interested in them.

        The last font is a useful catch-all font that supplies most of the
        remaining unicode characters.

    boldFont: *fontlist*
    italicFont: *fontlist*
    boldItalicFont: *fontlist*
        The font list to use for displaying bold, *italic* or *bold italic*
        characters, respectively.

        If specified and non-empty, then the syntax is the same as for the
        font-resource, and the given font list will be used as is, which
        makes it possible to substitute completely different font styles for
        bold and italic.

        If unset (the default), a suitable font list will be synthesized by
        "morphing" the normal text font list into the desired shape. If that
        is not possible, replacement fonts of the desired shape will be
        tried.

        If set, but empty, then this specific style is disabled and the
        normal text font will being used for the given style.

    intensityStyles: *boolean*
        When font styles are not enabled, or this option is enabled (True,
        option -is, the default), bold and italic font styles imply high
        intensity foreground/backround colours. Disabling this option
        (False, option +is) disables this behaviour, the high intensity
        colours are not reachable.

    selectstyle: *mode*
        Set mouse selection style to old which is 2.20, oldword which is
        xterm style with 2.20 old word selection, or anything else which
        gives xterm style selection.

    scrollstyle: *mode*
        Set scrollbar style to rxvt, plain, next or xterm. plain is the
        author's favourite.

    title: *string*
        Set window title string, the default title is the command-line
        specified after the -e option, if any, otherwise the application
        name; option -title.

    iconName: *string*
        Set the name used to label the window's icon or displayed in an icon
        manager window, it also sets the window's title unless it is
        explicitly set; option -n.

    mapAlert: *boolean*
        True: de-iconify (map) on receipt of a bell character. False: no
        de-iconify (map) on receipt of a bell character [default].

    visualBell: *boolean*
        True: use visual bell on receipt of a bell character; option -vb.
        False: no visual bell [default]; option +vb.

    loginShell: *boolean*
        True: start as a login shell by prepending a `-' to argv[0] of the
        shell; option -ls. False: start as a normal sub-shell [default];
        option +ls.

    utmpInhibit: *boolean*
        True: inhibit writing record into the system log file utmp; option
        -ut. False: write record into the system log file utmp [default];
        option +ut.

    print-pipe: *string*
        Specify a command pipe for vt100 printer [default *lpr(1)*]. Use
        Print to initiate a screen dump to the printer and Ctrl-Print or
        Shift-Print to include the scrollback as well.

        The string will be interpreted as if typed into the shell as-is.

        Example:

           URxvt*print-pipe: cat > $(TMPDIR=$HOME mktemp urxvt.XXXXXX)

        This creates a new file in your home directory with the screen
        contents everytime you hit "Print".

    scrollBar: *boolean*
        True: enable the scrollbar [default]; option -sb. False: disable the
        scrollbar; option +sb.

    scrollBar_right: *boolean*
        True: place the scrollbar on the right of the window; option -sr.
        False: place the scrollbar on the left of the window; option +sr.

    scrollBar_floating: *boolean*
        True: display an rxvt scrollbar without a trough; option -st. False:
        display an rxvt scrollbar with a trough; option +st.

    scrollBar_align: *mode*
        Align the top, bottom or centre [default] of the scrollbar thumb
        with the pointer on middle button press/drag.

    scrollTtyOutput: *boolean*
        True: scroll to bottom when tty receives output; option -si. False:
        do not scroll to bottom when tty receives output; option +si.

    scrollWithBuffer: *boolean*
        True: scroll with scrollback buffer when tty receives new lines (and
        scrollTtyOutput is False); option -sw. False: do not scroll with
        scrollback buffer when tty recieves new lines; option +sw.

    scrollTtyKeypress: *boolean*
        True: scroll to bottom when a non-special key is pressed. Special
        keys are those which are intercepted by rxvt-unicode for special
        handling and are not passed onto the shell; option -sk. False: do
        not scroll to bottom when a non-special key is pressed; option +sk.

    saveLines: *number*
        Save *number* lines in the scrollback buffer [default 64]. This
        resource is limited on most machines to 65535; option -sl.

    internalBorder: *number*
        Internal border of *number* pixels. This resource is limited to 100;
        option -b.

    externalBorder: *number*
        External border of *number* pixels. This resource is limited to 100;
        option -w, -bw, -borderwidth.

    borderLess: *boolean*
        Set MWM hints to request a borderless window, i.e. if honoured by
        the WM, the rxvt-unicode window will not have window decorations;
        option -bl.

    skipBuiltinGlyphs: *boolean*
        Compile *frills*: Disable the usage of the built-in block
        graphics/line drawing characters and just rely on what the specified
        fonts provide. Use this if you have a good font and want to use its
        block graphic glyphs; option -sbg.

    termName: *termname*
        Specifies the terminal type name to be set in the TERM environment
        variable; option -tn.

    linespace: *number*
        Specifies number of lines (pixel height) to insert between each row
        of the display [default 0]; option -lsp.

    meta8: *boolean*
        True: handle Meta (Alt) + keypress to set the 8th bit. False: handle
        Meta (Alt) + keypress as an escape prefix [default].

    mouseWheelScrollPage: *boolean*
        True: the mouse wheel scrolls a page full. False: the mouse wheel
        scrolls five lines [default].

    pastableTabs: *boolean*
        True: store tabs as wide characters. False: interpret tabs as cursor
        movement only; option "-ptab".

    cursorBlink: *boolean*
        True: blink the cursor. False: do not blink the cursor [default];
        option -bc.

    pointerBlank: *boolean*
        True: blank the pointer when a key is pressed or after a set number
        of seconds of inactivity. False: the pointer is always visible
        [default].

    pointerColor: *colour*
        Mouse pointer foreground colour.

    pointerColor2: *colour*
        Mouse pointer background colour.

    pointerBlankDelay: *number*
        Specifies number of seconds before blanking the pointer [default 2].
        Use a large number (e.g. 987654321) to effectively disable the
        timeout.

    backspacekey: *string*
        The string to send when the backspace key is pressed. If set to DEC
        or unset it will send Delete (code 127) or, if shifted, Backspace
        (code 8) - which can be reversed with the appropriate DEC private
        mode escape sequence.

    deletekey: *string*
        The string to send when the delete key (not the keypad delete key)
        is pressed. If unset it will send the sequence traditionally
        associated with the Execute key.

    cutchars: *string*
        The characters used as delimiters for double-click word selection.
        The built-in default:

        BACKSLASH `"'&()*,;<=>?@[]{|}

    preeditType: *style*
        OverTheSpot, OffTheSpot, Root; option -pt.

    inputMethod: *name*
        *name* of inputMethod to use; option -im.

    imLocale: *name*
        The locale to use for opening the IM. You can use an "LC_CTYPE" of
        e.g. "de_DE.UTF-8" for normal text processing but "ja_JP.EUC-JP" for
        the input extension to be able to input japanese characters while
        staying in another locale; option -imlocale.

    imFont: *fontset*
        Specify the font-set used for XIM styles "OverTheSpot" or
        "OffTheSpot". It must be a standard X font set (XLFD patterns
        separated by commas), i.e. it's not in the same format as the other
        font lists used in rxvt. The default will be set-up to chose *any*
        suitable found found, preferably one or two pixels differing in size
        to the base font. option -imfont.

    tripleclickwords: *boolean*
        Change the meaning of triple-click selection with the left mouse
        button. Instead of selecting a full line it will extend the
        selection to the end of the logical line only; option -tcw.

    insecure: *boolean*
        Enables "insecure" mode. Rxvt-unicode offers some escape sequences
        that echo arbitrary strings like the icon name or the locale. This
        could be abused if somebody gets 8-bit-clean access to your display,
        whether through a mail client displaying mail bodies unfiltered or
        through write(1) or any other means. Therefore, these sequences are
        disabled by default. (Note that many other terminals, including
        xterm, have these sequences enabled by default, which doesn't make
        it safer, though).

        You can enable them by setting this boolean resource or specifying
        -insecure as an option. At the moment, this enables display-answer,
        locale, findfont, icon label and window title requests as well as
        dynamic menubar dispatch.

    modifier: *modifier*
        Set the key to be interpreted as the Meta key to: alt, meta, hyper,
        super, mod1, mod2, mod3, mod4, mod5; option -mod.

    answerbackString: *string*
        Specify the reply rxvt-unicode sends to the shell when an ENQ
        (control-E) character is passed through. It may contain escape
        values as described in the entry on keysym following.

    secondaryScreen: *bool*
        Turn on/off secondary screen (default enabled).

    secondaryScroll: *bool*
        Turn on/off secondary screen scroll (default enabled). If the this
        option is enabled, scrolls on the secondary screen will change the
        scrollback buffer and switching to/from the secondary screen will
        instead scroll the screen up.

    hold: *bool*
        Turn on/off hold window after exit support. If enabled, rxvt will
        not immediately destroy its window when the program executed within
        it exits. Instead, it will wait till it is being killed or closed by
        the user.

    keysym.*sym*: *string*
        Compile *frills*: Associate *string* with keysym *sym*. The
        intervening resource name keysym. cannot be omitted.

        The format of *sym* is "*(modifiers-)key*", where *modifiers* can be
        any combination of ISOLevel3, AppKeypad, Control, NumLock, Shift,
        Meta, Lock, Mod1, Mod2, Mod3, Mod4, Mod5, and the abbreviated I, K,
        C, N, S, M, A, L, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

        The NumLock, Meta and ISOLevel3 modifiers are usually aliased to
        whatever modifier the NumLock key, Meta/Alt keys or ISO Level3
        Shift/AltGr keys are being mapped. AppKeypad is a synthetic modifier
        mapped to the current application keymap mode state.

        The spellings of *key* can be obtained by using xev(1) command or
        searching keysym macros from /usr/X11R6/include/X11/keysymdef.h and
        omitting the prefix XK_. Alternatively you can specify *key* by its
        hex keysym value (0x0000 - 0xFFFF). Note that the lookup of *sym*s
        is not performed in an exact manner; however, the closest match is
        assured.

        *string* may contain escape values ("\a": bell, "\b": backspace,
        "\e", "\E": escape, "\n": newline, "\r": carriage return, "\t": tab,
        "\000": octal number) or verbatim control characters ("^?": delete,
        "^@": null, "^A" ...) and may be enclosed with double quotes so that
        it can start or end with whitespace.

        Please note that you need to double the "\" in resource files, as
        Xlib itself does it's own de-escaping (you can use "\033" instead of
        "\e" (and so on), which will work with both Xt and rxvt's own
        processing).

        You can define a range of keysyms in one shot by providing a
        *string* with pattern list/PREFIX/MIDDLE/SUFFIX, where the delimeter
        `/' should be a character not used by the strings.

        Its usage can be demonstrated by an example:

          URxvt.keysym.M-C-0x61:    list|\033<M-C-|abc|>

        The above line is equivalent to the following three lines:

          URxvt.keysym.Meta-Control-0x61:    \033<M-C-a>
          URxvt.keysym.Meta-Control-0x62:    \033<M-C-b>
          URxvt.keysym.Meta-Control-0x63:    \033<M-C-c>

        If *string* takes the form of "command:STRING", the specified STRING
        is interpreted and executed as rxvt's control sequence. For example
        the following means "change the current locale to "zh_CN.GBK" when
        Control-Meta-c is being pressed":

          URxvt.keysym.M-C-c: command:\033]701;zh_CN.GBK\007

        If *string* takes the form "perl:STRING", then the specified STRING
        is passed to the "on_keyboard_command" perl handler. See the
        rxvtperl(3) manpage. For example, the selection extension (activated
        via "rxvt -pe selection") listens for "selection:rot13" events:

          URxvt.keysym.M-C-c: perl:selection:rot13

        Due the the large number of modifier combinations, a defined key
        mapping will match if at *at least* the specified identifiers are
        being set, and no other key mappings with those and more bits are
        being defined. That means that defining a key map for "a" will
        automatically provide definitions for "Meta-a", "Shift-a" and so on,
        unless some of those are defined mappings themselves.

        Unfortunately, this will override built-in key mappings. For example
        if you overwrite the "Insert" key you will disable rxvt's
        "Shift-Insert" mapping. To re-enable that, you can poke "holes" into
        the user-defined keymap using the "builtin:" replacement:

          URxvt.keysym.Insert: <my insert key sequence>
          URxvt.keysym.S-Insert: builtin:

        The first line defines a mapping for "Insert" and *any* combination
        of modifiers. The second line re-establishes the default mapping for
        "Shift-Insert".

        The following example will map Control-Meta-1 and Control-Meta-2 to
        the fonts "suxuseuro" and "9x15bold", so you can have some limited
        font-switching at runtime:

          URxvt.keysym.M-C-1: command:\033]50;suxuseuro\007
          URxvt.keysym.M-C-2: command:\033]50;9x15bold\007

        Other things are possible, e.g. resizing (see rxvt(7) for more
        info):

          URxvt.keysym.M-C-3: command:\033[8;25;80t
          URxvt.keysym.M-C-4: command:\033[8;48;110t

    perl-ext-common: *string*
    perl-ext: *string*
        Comma-separated list(s) of perl extension scripts (default:
        "default") to use in this terminal instance; option -pe.

        Extension names can be prefixed with a "-" sign to prohibit using
        them. This can be useful to selectively disable some extensions
        loaded by default, or specified via the "perl-ext-common" resource.
        For example, "default,-selection" will use all the default extension
        except "selection".

        Extension names can also be followed by an argument in angle
        brackets (e.g. "searchable-scrollback<M-s>", which binds the hotkey
        for searchable scorllback to Alt/Meta-s). Mentioning the same
        extension multiple times with different arguments will pass multiple
        arguments to the extension.

        Each extension is looked up in the library directories, loaded if
        necessary, and bound to the current terminal instance.

        If both of these resources are the empty string, then the perl
        interpreter will not be initialized. The idea behind two options is
        that perl-ext-common will be used for extensions that should be
        available to all instances, while perl-ext is used for specific
        instances.

    perl-eval: *string*
        Perl code to be evaluated when all extensions have been registered.
        See the rxvtperl(3) manpage. Due to security reasons, this resource
        will be ignored when running setuid/setgid.

    perl-lib: *path*
        Colon-separated list of additional directories that hold extension
        scripts. When looking for extensions specified by the "perl"
        resource, rxvt will first look in these directories and then in
        /opt/rxvt/lib/urxvt/perl/. Due to security reasons, this resource
        will be ignored when running setuid/setgid.

        See the rxvtperl(3) manpage.

    selection.pattern-*idx*: *perl-regex*
        Additional selection patterns, see the rxvtperl(3) manpage for
        details.

    selection-autotransform.*idx*: *perl-transform*
        Selection auto-transform patterns, see the rxvtperl(3) manpage for
        details.

    searchable-scrollback: *keysym*
        Sets the hotkey that starts the incremental scrollback buffer search
        (default: "M-s").

    urlLauncher: *string*
        Specifies the program to be started with a URL argument. Used by the
        "selection-popup" and "mark-urls" perl extensions.

    transient-for: *windowid*
        Sets the WM_TRANSIENT_FOR property to the given window iw.

THE SCROLLBAR
    Lines of text that scroll off the top of the rxvt window (resource:
    saveLines) and can be scrolled back using the scrollbar or by
    keystrokes. The normal rxvt scrollbar has arrows and its behaviour is
    fairly intuitive. The xterm-scrollbar is without arrows and its
    behaviour mimics that of *xterm*

    Scroll down with Button1 (xterm-scrollbar) or Shift-Next. Scroll up with
    Button3 (xterm-scrollbar) or Shift-Prior. Continuous scroll with
    Button2.

MOUSE REPORTING
    To temporarily override mouse reporting, for either the scrollbar or the
    normal text selection/insertion, hold either the Shift or the Meta (Alt)
    key while performing the desired mouse action.

    If mouse reporting mode is active, the normal scrollbar actions are
    disabled -- on the assumption that we are using a fullscreen
    application. Instead, pressing Button1 and Button3 sends ESC [ 6 ~
    (Next) and ESC [ 5 ~ (Prior), respectively. Similarly, clicking on the
    up and down arrows sends ESC [ A (Up) and ESC [ B (Down), respectively.

TEXT SELECTION AND INSERTION
    The behaviour of text selection and insertion mechanism is similar to
    *xterm*(1).

    Selection:
        Left click at the beginning of the region, drag to the end of the
        region and release; Right click to extend the marked region; Left
        double-click to select a word; Left triple-click to select the
        entire logical line (which can span multiple screen lines), unless
        modified by resource tripleclickwords.

        Starting a selection while pressing the Meta key (or Meta+Ctrl keys)
        (Compile: *frills*) will create a rectangular selection instead of a
        normal one. In this mode, every selected row becomes its own line in
        the selection, and trailing whitespace is visually underlined and
        removed from the selection.

    Insertion:
        Pressing and releasing the Middle mouse button (or Shift-Insert) in
        an rxvt window causes the current text selection to be inserted as
        if it had been typed on the keyboard.

CHANGING FONTS
    Changing fonts (or font sizes, respectively) via the keypad is not yet
    supported in rxvt-unicode. Bug me if you need this.

    You can, however, switch fonts at runtime using escape sequences (and
    therefore using the menubar), e.g.:

       printf '\e]710;%s\007' "9x15bold,xft:Kochi Gothic"

    rxvt-unicode will automatically re-apply these fonts to the output so
    far.

ISO 14755 SUPPORT
    ISO 14755 is a standard for entering and viewing unicode characters and
    character codes using the keyboard. It consists of 4 parts. The first
    part is available rxvt-unicode has been compiled with "--enable-frills",
    the rest is available when rxvt-unicode was compiled with
    "--enable-iso14755".

    * 5.1: Basic method
        This allows you to enter unicode characters using their hexcode.

        Start by pressing and holding both "Control" and "Shift", then enter
        hex-digits (between one and six). Releasing "Control" and "Shift"
        will commit the character as if it were typed directly. While
        holding down "Control" and "Shift" you can also enter multiple
        characters by pressing "Space", which will commit the current
        character and lets you start a new one.

        As an example of use, imagine a business card with a japanese e-mail
        address, which you cannot type. Fortunately, the card has the e-mail
        address printed as hexcodes, e.g. "671d 65e5". You can enter this
        easily by pressing "Control" and "Shift", followed by
        "6-7-1-D-SPACE-6-5-E-5", followed by releasing the modifier keys.

    * 5.2: Keyboard symbols entry method
        This mode lets you input characters representing the keycap symbols
        of your keyboard, if representable in the current locale encoding.

        Start by pressing "Control" and "Shift" together, then releasing
        them. The next special key (cursor keys, home etc.) you enter will
        not invoke it's usual function but instead will insert the
        corresponding keycap symbol. The symbol will only be entered when
        the key has been released, otherwise pressing e.g. "Shift" would
        enter the symbol for "ISO Level 2 Switch", although your intention
        might have been to enter a reverse tab (Shift-Tab).

    * 5.3: Screen-selection entry method
        While this is implemented already (it's basically the selection
        mechanism), it could be extended by displaying a unicode character
        map.

    * 5.4: Feedback method for identifying displayed characters for later
    input
        This method lets you display the unicode character code associated
        with characters already displayed.

        You enter this mode by holding down "Control" and "Shift" together,
        then pressing and holding the left mouse button and moving around.
        The unicode hex code(s) (it might be a combining character) of the
        character under the pointer is displayed until you release "Control"
        and "Shift".

        In addition to the hex codes it will display the font used to draw
        this character - due to implementation reasons, characters combined
        with combining characters, line drawing characters and unknown
        characters will always be drawn using the built-in support font.

    With respect to conformance, rxvt-unicode is supposed to be compliant to
    both scenario A and B of ISO 14755, including part 5.2.

LOGIN STAMP
    rxvt tries to write an entry into the *utmp*(5) file so that it can be
    seen via the *who(1)* command, and can accept messages. To allow this
    feature, rxvt may need to be installed setuid root on some systems or
    setgid to root or to some other group on others.

COLORS AND GRAPHICS
    In addition to the default foreground and background colours, rxvt can
    display up to 16 colours (8 ANSI colours plus high-intensity bold/blink
    versions of the same). Here is a list of the colours with their rgb.txt
    names.

       color0          (black)         = Black         
       color1          (red)           = Red3          
       color2          (green)         = Green3        
       color3          (yellow)        = Yellow3       
       color4          (blue)          = Blue3         
       color5          (magenta)       = Magenta3      
       color6          (cyan)          = Cyan3         
       color7          (white)         = AntiqueWhite  
       color8          (bright black)  = Grey25        
       color9          (bright red)    = Red           
       color10         (bright green)  = Green         
       color11         (bright yellow) = Yellow        
       color12         (bright blue)   = Blue          
       color13         (bright magenta) = Magenta       
       color14         (bright cyan)   = Cyan          
       color15         (bright white)  = White         
       foreground                      = Black         
       background                      = White         

    It is also possible to specify the colour values of foreground,
    background, cursorColor, cursorColor2, colorBD, colorUL as a number
    0-15, as a convenient shorthand to reference the colour name of
    color0-color15.

    Note that -rv ("reverseVideo: True") simulates reverse video by always
    swapping the foreground/background colours. This is in contrast to
    *xterm*(1) where the colours are only swapped if they have not otherwise
    been specified. For example,

    rxvt -fg Black -bg White -rv
        would yield White on Black, while on *xterm*(1) it would yield Black
        on White.

ENVIRONMENT
    rxvt sets and/or uses the following environment variables:

    TERM
        Normally set to "rxvt-unicode", unless overwritten at configure
        time, via resources or on the commandline.

    COLORTERM
        Either "rxvt", "rxvt-xpm", depending on wether rxvt was compiled
        with XPM support, and optionally with the added extension "-mono" to
        indicate that rxvt-unicode runs on a monochrome screen.

    COLORFGBG
        Set to a string of the form "fg;bg" or "fg;xpm;bg", where "fg" is
        the colour code used as default foreground/text colour (or the
        string "default" to indicate that the default-colour escape sequence
        is to be used), "bg" is the colour code used as default background
        colour (or the string "default"), and "xpm" is the string "default"
        if rxvt was compiled with XPM support. Libraries like "ncurses" and
        "slang" can (and do) use this information to optimize screen output.

    WINDOWID
        Set to the (decimal) X Window ID of the rxvt window (the toplevel
        window, which usually has subwindows for the scrollbar, the terminal
        window and so on).

    TERMINFO
        Set to the terminfo directory iff rxvt was configured with
        "--with-terminfo=PATH".

    DISPLAY
        Used by rxvt to connect to the display and set to the correct
        display in it's child processes.

    SHELL
        The shell to be used for command execution, defaults to "/bin/sh".

    RXVTPATH
        The path where rxvt looks for support files such as menu and xpm
        files.

    PATH
        Used in the same way as "RXVTPATH".

    RXVT_SOCKET
        The unix domain socket path used by rxvtc(1) and rxvtd(1).

        Default $HOME/.rxvt-unicode-*<nodename*.

    HOME
        Used to locate the default directory for the unix domain socket for
        daemon communications and to locate various resource files (such as
        ".Xdefaults")

    XAPPLRESDIR
        Directory where various X resource files are being located.

    XENVIRONMENT
        If set and accessible, gives the name of a X resource file to be
        loaded by rxvt.

FILES
    /usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt
        Color names.
