<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="item_the_new_selection_selects_pieces_that_are_too_big_">The new selection selects pieces that are too big, how can I select
single words?</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
Yes. For example, if you want to select alphanumeric words, you can use
the following resource:
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
   URxvt.selection.pattern-0: ([[:word:]]+)</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>If you click more than twice, the selection will be extended
more and more.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>To get a selection that is very similar to the old code, try this pattern:</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
   URxvt.selection.pattern-0: ([^&quot;&amp;'()*,;&lt;=&gt;?@[\\\\]^`{|})]+)</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Please also note that the <em>LeftClick Shift-LeftClik</em> combination also
selects words like the old code.</p>
</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_i_don_27t_like_the_new_selection_2fpopups_2fhotkey">I don't like the new selection/popups/hotkeys/perl, how do I
change/disable it?</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
You can disable the perl extension completely by setting the
<strong>perl-ext-common</strong> resource to the empty string, which also keeps
rxvt-unicode from initialising perl, saving memory.
</dd>
<dd>
<p>If you only want to disable specific features, you first have to
identify which perl extension is responsible. For this, read the section
<strong>PREPACKAGED EXTENSIONS</strong> in the <code>rxvtperl(3)</code> manpage. For
example, to disable the <strong>selection-popup</strong> and <strong>option-popup</strong>, specify
this <strong>perl-ext-common</strong> resource:</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
   URxvt.perl-ext-common: default,-selection-popup,-option-popup</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>This will keep the default extensions, but disable the two popup
extensions. Some extensions can also be configured, for example,
scrollback search mode is triggered by <strong>M-s</strong>. You can move it to any
other combination either by setting the <strong>searchable-scrollback</strong> resource:</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
   URxvt.searchable-scrollback: CM-s</pre>
</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_why_doesn_27t_rxvt_2dunicode_read_my_resources_3f">Why doesn't rxvt-unicode read my resources?</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
Well, why, indeed? It does, in a way very similar to other X
applications. Most importantly, this means that if you or your OS loads
resources into the X display (the right way to do it), rxvt-unicode will
ignore any resource files in your home directory. It will only read
<em>$HOME/.Xdefaults</em> when no resources are attached to the display.
</dd>
<dd>
<p>If you have or use an <em>$HOME/.Xresources</em> file, chances are that
resources are loaded into your X-server. In this case, you have to
re-login after every change (or run <em>xrdb -merge $HOME/.Xresources</em>).</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Also consider the form resources have to use:</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
  URxvt.resource: value</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>If you want to use another form (there are lots of different ways of
specifying resources), make sure you understand wether and why it
works. If unsure, use the form above.</p>
</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_i_can_27t_get_transparency_working_2c_what_am_i_do">I can't get transparency working, what am I doing wrong?</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
First of all, transparency isn't officially supported in rxvt-unicode, so
you are mostly on your own. Do not bug the author about it (but you may
bug everybody else). Also, if you can't get it working consider it a rite
of passage, and you failed.
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Here are three ways to get transparency. <strong>Do</strong> read the manpage and option
descriptions for the programs mentioned and rxvt-unicode. Really, do it!</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>1. Use inheritPixmap:</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
   Esetroot wallpaper.jpg
   rxvt -ip -tint red -sh 40</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>That works. If you think it doesn't, you lack transparency and tinting
support, or you are unable to read.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>2. Use a simple pixmap and emulate pseudo-transparency. This enables you
to use effects other than tinting and shading: Just shade/tint/whatever
your picture with gimp:</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
   convert wallpaper.jpg -blur 20x20 -modulate 30 background.xpm
   rxvt -pixmap background.xpm -pe automove-background</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>That works. If you think it doesn't, you lack XPM and Perl support, or you
are unable to read.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>3. Use an ARGB visual:</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
   rxvt -depth 432 -fg grey90 -bg rgba:0000/0000/0000/c000</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>This requires XFT support, and support form your X-server. If that doesn't
work for you, blame Xorg and Keith Packard. ARGB visuals aren't there yet,
no matter what they claim. Rxvt-Unicode contains the neccessary bugfixes
and workarounds for Xft and Xlib to make it work.</p>
</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_isn_27t_rxvt_supposed_to_be_small_3f_don_27t_all_t">Isn't rxvt supposed to be small? Don't all those features bloat?</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
I often get asked about this, and I think, no, they didn't cause extra
bloat. If you compare a minimal rxvt and a minimal urxvt, you can see
that the urxvt binary is larger (due to some encoding tables always being
compiled in), but it actually uses less memory (RSS) after startup. Even
with <code>--disable-everything</code>, this comparison is a bit unfair, as many
features unique to urxvt (locale, encoding conversion, iso14755 etc.) are
already in use in this mode.
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
    text    data     bss     drs     rss filename
   98398    1664      24   15695    1824 rxvt --disable-everything
  188985    9048   66616   18222    1788 urxvt --disable-everything</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>When you <a href="#item__2d_2denable_2deverything"><code>--enable-everything</code></a> (which _is_ unfair, as this involves xft
and full locale/XIM support which are quite bloaty inside libX11 and my
libc), the two diverge, but not unreasnobaly so.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
    text    data     bss     drs     rss filename
  163431    2152      24   20123    2060 rxvt --enable-everything
 1035683   49680   66648   29096    3680 urxvt --enable-everything</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>The very large size of the text section is explained by the east-asian
encoding tables, which, if unused, take up disk space but nothing else
and can be compiled out unless you rely on X11 core fonts that use those
encodings. The BSS size comes from the 64k emergency buffer that my c++
compiler allocates (but of course doesn't use unless you are out of
memory). Also, using an xft font instead of a core font immediately adds a
few megabytes of RSS. Xft indeed is responsible for a lot of RSS even when
not used.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Of course, due to every character using two or four bytes instead of one,
a large scrollback buffer will ultimately make rxvt-unicode use more
memory.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Compared to e.g. Eterm (5112k), aterm (3132k) and xterm (4680k), this
still fares rather well. And compared to some monsters like gnome-terminal
(21152k + extra 4204k in separate processes) or konsole (22200k + extra
43180k in daemons that stay around after exit, plus half a minute of
startup time, including the hundreds of warnings it spits out), it fares
extremely well *g*.</p>
</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_why_c_2b_2b_2c_isn_27t_that_unportable_2fbloated_2">Why C++, isn't that unportable/bloated/uncool?</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
Is this a question? :) It comes up very often. The simple answer is: I had
to write it, and C++ allowed me to write and maintain it in a fraction
of the time and effort (which is a scarce resource for me). Put even
shorter: It simply wouldn't exist without C++.
</dd>
<dd>
<p>My personal stance on this is that C++ is less portable than C, but in
the case of rxvt-unicode this hardly matters, as its portability limits
are defined by things like X11, pseudo terminals, locale support and unix
domain sockets, which are all less portable than C++ itself.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Regarding the bloat, see the above question: It's easy to write programs
in C that use gobs of memory, an certainly possible to write programs in
C++ that don't. C++ also often comes with large libraries, but this is
not necessarily the case with GCC. Here is what rxvt links against on my
system with a minimal config:</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
   libX11.so.6 =&gt; /usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.so.6 (0x00002aaaaabc3000)

   /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00002aaaaaaab000)</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>And here is rxvt-unicode:</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>

   /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00002aaaaaaab000)</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>No large bloated libraries (of course, none were linked in statically),
except maybe libX11 :)</p>
</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_does_it_support_tabs_2c_can_i_have_a_tabbed_rxvt_2">Does it support tabs, can I have a tabbed rxvt-unicode?</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
Beginning with version 7.3, there is a perl extension that implements a
simple tabbed terminal. It is installed by default, so any of these should
give you tabs:
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
   rxvt -pe tabbed</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
   URxvt.perl-ext-common: default,tabbed</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>It will also work fine with tabbing functionality of many window managers
or similar tabbing programs, and its embedding-features allow it to be
embedded into other programs, as witnessed by <em>doc/rxvt-tabbed</em> or
the upcoming <code>Gtk2::URxvt</code> perl module, which features a tabbed urxvt
(murxvt) terminal as an example embedding application.</p>
</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_how_do_i_know_which_rxvt_2dunicode_version_i_27m_u">How do I know which rxvt-unicode version I'm using?</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
The version number is displayed with the usage (-h). Also the escape
sequence <code>ESC [ 8 n</code> sets the window title to the version number. When
using the rxvtc client, the version displayed is that of the
daemon.
</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_i_am_using_debian_gnu_2flinux_and_have_a_problem_2">I am using Debian GNU/Linux and have a problem...</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
The Debian GNU/Linux package of rxvt-unicode in sarge contains large
patches that considerably change the behaviour of rxvt-unicode (but
unfortunately this notice has been removed). Before reporting a bug to
the original rxvt-unicode author please download and install the genuine
version (<a href="http://software.schmorp.de#rxvt-unicode">http://software.schmorp.de#rxvt-unicode</a>) and try to reproduce
the problem. If you cannot, chances are that the problems are specific to
Debian GNU/Linux, in which case it should be reported via the Debian Bug
Tracking System (use <code>reportbug</code> to report the bug).
</dd>
<dd>
<p>For other problems that also affect the Debian package, you can and
probably should use the Debian BTS, too, because, after all, it's also a
bug in the Debian version and it serves as a reminder for other users that
might encounter the same issue.</p>
</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_i_am_maintaining_rxvt_2dunicode_for_distribution_2">I am maintaining rxvt-unicode for distribution/OS XXX, any
recommendation?</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
You should build one binary with the default options. <em>configure</em>
now enables most useful options, and the trend goes to making them
runtime-switchable, too, so there is usually no drawback to enbaling them,
except higher disk and possibly memory usage. The perl interpreter should
be enabled, as important functionality (menus, selection, likely more in
the future) depends on it.
</dd>
<dd>
<p>You should not overwrite the <code>perl-ext-common</code> snd <code>perl-ext</code> resources
system-wide (except maybe with <code>defaults</code>). This will result in useful
behaviour. If your distribution aims at low memory, add an empty
<code>perl-ext-common</code> resource to the app-defaults file. This will keep the
perl interpreter disabled until the user enables it.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>If you can/want build more binaries, I recommend building a minimal
one with <code>--disable-everything</code> (very useful) and a maximal one with
<a href="#item__2d_2denable_2deverything"><code>--enable-everything</code></a> (less useful, it will be very big due to a lot of
encodings built-in that increase download times and are rarely used).</p>
</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_i_need_to_make_it_setuid_2fsetgid_to_support_utmp_">I need to make it setuid/setgid to support utmp/ptys on my OS, is this safe?</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
It should be, starting with release 7.1. You are encouraged to properly
install urxvt with privileges necessary for your OS now.
</dd>
<dd>
<p>When rxvt-unicode detects that it runs setuid or setgid, it will fork
into a helper process for privileged operations (pty handling on some
systems, utmp/wtmp/lastlog handling on others) and drop privileges
immediately. This is much safer than most other terminals that keep
privileges while running (but is more relevant to urxvt, as it contains
things as perl interpreters, which might be ``helpful'' to attackers).</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>This forking is done as the very first within main(), which is very early
and reduces possible bugs to initialisation code run before main(), or
things like the dynamic loader of your system, which should result in very
little risk.</p>
</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_when_i_log_2din_to_another_system_it_tells_me_abou">When I log-in to another system it tells me about missing terminfo data?</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
The terminal description used by rxvt-unicode is not as widely available
as that for xterm, or even rxvt (for which the same problem often arises).
</dd>
<dd>
<p>The correct solution for this problem is to install the terminfo, this can
be done like this (with ncurses' infocmp):</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
   REMOTE=remotesystem.domain
   infocmp rxvt-unicode | ssh $REMOTE &quot;cat &gt;/tmp/ti &amp;&amp; tic /tmp/ti&quot;</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>... or by installing rxvt-unicode normally on the remote system,</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>If you cannot or do not want to do this, then you can simply set
<code>TERM=rxvt</code> or even <code>TERM=xterm</code>, and live with the small number of
problems arising, which includes wrong keymapping, less and different
colours and some refresh errors in fullscreen applications. It's a nice
quick-and-dirty workaround for rare cases, though.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>If you always want to do this (and are fine with the consequences) you
can either recompile rxvt-unicode with the desired TERM value or use a
resource to set it:</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
   URxvt.termName: rxvt</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>If you don't plan to use <strong>rxvt</strong> (quite common...) you could also replace
the rxvt terminfo file with the rxvt-unicode one.</p>
</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_tic_outputs_some_error_when_compiling_the_terminfo"><code>tic</code> outputs some error when compiling the terminfo entry.</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
Most likely it's the empty definition for <code>enacs=</code>. Just replace it by
<code>enacs=\E[0@</code> and try again.
</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_bash_27s_readline_does_not_work_correctly_under_rx"><code>bash</code>'s readline does not work correctly under rxvt.</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dt><strong><a name="item_i_need_a_termcap_file_entry_2e">I need a termcap file entry.</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
One reason you might want this is that some distributions or operating
systems still compile some programs using the long-obsoleted termcap
library (Fedora Core's bash is one example) and rely on a termcap entry
for <code>rxvt-unicode</code>.
</dd>
<dd>
<p>You could use rxvt's termcap entry with resonable results in many cases.
You can also create a termcap entry by using terminfo's infocmp program
like this:</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
   infocmp -C rxvt-unicode</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Or you could use this termcap entry, generated by the command above:</p>

by setting <code>TERM</code> to <code>rxvt</code>, which doesn't have these extra

Most fonts do not contain the full range of Unicode, which is
fine. Chances are that the font you (or the admin/package maintainer of
your system/os) have specified does not cover all the characters you want
to display.
</dd>
<dd>
<p><strong>rxvt-unicode</strong> makes a best-effort try at finding a replacement
font. Often the result is fine, but sometimes the chosen font looks
bad/ugly/wrong. Some fonts have totally strange characters that don't
resemble the correct glyph at all, and rxvt-unicode lacks the artificial
intelligence to detect that a specific glyph is wrong: it has to believe
the font that the characters it claims to contain indeed look correct.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>In that case, select a font of your taste and add it to the font list,
e.g.:</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
   rxvt -fn basefont,font2,font3...</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>When rxvt-unicode sees a character, it will first look at the base
font. If the base font does not contain the character, it will go to the
next font, and so on. Specifying your own fonts will also speed up this
search and use less resources within rxvt-unicode and the X-server.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>The only limitation is that none of the fonts may be larger than the base

must be the same due to the way terminals work.</p>

<dt><strong><a name="item_why_do_some_chinese_characters_look_so_different_t">Why do some chinese characters look so different than others?</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
This is because there is a difference between script and language --
rxvt-unicode does not know which language the text that is output is,
as it only knows the unicode character codes. If rxvt-unicode first
sees a japanese/chinese character, it might choose a japanese font for
display. Subsequent japanese characters will use that font. Now, many
chinese characters aren't represented in japanese fonts, so when the first
non-japanese character comes up, rxvt-unicode will look for a chinese font
-- unfortunately at this point, it will still use the japanese font for
chinese characters that are also in the japanese font.
</dd>
<dd>
<p>The workaround is easy: just tag a chinese font at the end of your font
list (see the previous question). The key is to view the font list as
a preference list: If you expect more japanese, list a japanese font
first. If you expect more chinese, put a chinese font first.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>In the future it might be possible to switch language preferences at
runtime (the internal data structure has no problem with using different
fonts for the same character at the same time, but no interface for this
has been designed yet).</p>

Most fonts were not designed for terminal use, which means that character
size varies a lot. A font that is otherwise fine for terminal use might
contain some characters that are simply too wide. Rxvt-unicode will avoid
these characters. For characters that are just ``a bit'' too wide a special
``careful'' rendering mode is used that redraws adjacent characters.
</dd>
<dd>
<p>All of this requires that fonts do not lie about character sizes,
however: Xft fonts often draw glyphs larger than their acclaimed bounding
box, and rxvt-unicode has no way of detecting this (the correct way is to
ask for the character bounding box, which unfortunately is wrong in these
cases).</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>It's not clear (to me at least), wether this is a bug in Xft, freetype,

the <code>-lsp</code> option to give the font more height. If that doesn't work, you
might be forced to use a different font.</p>

<dd>
<p>However, that means rxvt-unicode only works in <code>POSIX</code>, <code>ISO-8859-1</code> and

<dd>
<p><code>__STDC_ISO_10646__</code> is the only sane way to support multi-language

<p>Some applications (such as the formidable <strong>mlterm</strong>) work around this

</dd>
<dd>
<p>At the time of this writing, cygwin didn't seem to support any multi-byte

Unlike some other terminals, rxvt-unicode has no encoding switch, and no
specific ``utf-8'' mode, such as xterm. In fact, it doesn't even know about
UTF-8 or any other encodings with respect to terminal I/O.
</dd>
<dd>
<p>The reasons is that there exists a perfectly fine mechanism for selecting
the encoding, doing I/O and (most important) communicating this to all
applications so everybody agrees on character properties such as width
and code number. This mechanism is the <em>locale</em>. Applications not using
that info will have problems (for example, <code>xterm</code> gets the width of
characters wrong as it uses it's own, locale-independent table under all
locales).</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Rxvt-unicode uses the <code>LC_CTYPE</code> locale category to select encoding. All
programs doing the same (that is, most) will automatically agree in the
interpretation of characters.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no system-independent way to select locales, nor
is there a standard on how locale specifiers will look like.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>On most systems, the content of the <code>LC_CTYPE</code> environment variable
contains an arbitrary string which corresponds to an already-installed
locale. Common names for locales are <code>en_US.UTF-8</code>, <code>de_DE.ISO-8859-15</code>,
<code>ja_JP.EUC-JP</code>, i.e. <code>language_country.encoding</code>, but other forms
(i.e. <code>de</code> or <code>german</code>) are also common.</p>

<p>Rxvt-unicode ignores all other locale categories, and except for
the encoding, ignores country or language-specific settings,
i.e. <code>de_DE.UTF-8</code> and <code>ja_JP.UTF-8</code> are the normally same to
rxvt-unicode.</p>

<p>Sometimes this capability is rather handy when you want to work in
one locale (e.g. <code>de_DE.UTF-8</code>) but some programs don't support it

Rxvt-unicode tries to obey the rule of not charging you for something you

<p>Also, many people (me included) like large windows and even larger

6 bytes per screen cell. For a 160x?? window this amounts to almost a
kilobyte per line. A scrollback buffer of 10000 lines will then (if full)

<dt><strong><a name="item_what_27s_with_the_strange_backspace_2fdelete_key_b">What's with the strange Backspace/Delete key behaviour?</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
Assuming that the physical Backspace key corresponds to the
BackSpace keysym (not likely for Linux ... see the following
question) there are two standard values that can be used for
Backspace: <code>^H</code> and <code>^?</code>.
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Historically, either value is correct, but rxvt-unicode adopts the debian
policy of using <code>^?</code> when unsure, because it's the one only only correct
choice :).</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Rxvt-unicode tries to inherit the current stty settings and uses the value
of `erase' to guess the value for backspace.  If rxvt-unicode wasn't
started from a terminal (say, from a menu or by remote shell), then the
system value of `erase', which corresponds to CERASE in &lt;termios.h&gt;, will
be used (which may not be the same as your stty setting).</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>For starting a new rxvt-unicode:</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
   # use Backspace = ^H
   $ stty erase ^H
   $ rxvt</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
   # use Backspace = ^?
   $ stty erase ^?
   $ rxvt</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Toggle with <code>ESC [ 36 h</code> / <code>ESC [ 36 l</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>For an existing rxvt-unicode:</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
   # use Backspace = ^H
   $ stty erase ^H
   $ echo -n &quot;^[[36h&quot;</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
   # use Backspace = ^?
   $ stty erase ^?
   $ echo -n &quot;^[[36l&quot;</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>This helps satisfy some of the Backspace discrepancies that occur, but
if you use Backspace = <code>^H</code>, make sure that the termcap/terminfo value
properly reflects that.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>The Delete key is a another casualty of the ill-defined Backspace problem.
To avoid confusion between the Backspace and Delete keys, the Delete
key has been assigned an escape sequence to match the vt100 for Execute
(<code>ESC [ 3 ~</code>) and is in the supplied termcap/terminfo.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Some other Backspace problems:</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>some editors use termcap/terminfo,
some editors (vim I'm told) expect Backspace = ^H,
GNU Emacs (and Emacs-like editors) use ^H for help.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Perhaps someday this will all be resolved in a consistent manner.</p>

</dt>

rxvt and rxvt-unicode always export the variable ``COLORTERM'', so you can
check and see if that is set. Note that several programs, JED, slrn,
Midnight Commander automatically check this variable to decide whether or
not to use color.

If you've compiled rxvt-unicode with DISPLAY_IS_IP and have enabled
insecure mode then it is possible to use the following shell script
snippets to correctly set the display. If your version of rxvt-unicode
wasn't also compiled with ESCZ_ANSWER (as assumed in these snippets) then
the COLORTERM variable can be used to distinguish rxvt-unicode from a
regular xterm.

<h1><a name="configure_options">CONFIGURE OPTIONS</a></h1>
<p>General hint: if you get compile errors, then likely your configuration
hasn't been tested well. Either try with <a href="#item__2d_2denable_2deverything"><code>--enable-everything</code></a> or use
the <em>./reconf</em> script as a base for experiments. <em>./reconf</em> is used by
myself, so it should generally be a working config. Of course, you should
always report when a combination doesn't work, so it can be fixed. Marc
Lehmann &lt;<a href="mailto:rxvt@schmorp.de">rxvt@schmorp.de</a>&gt;.</p>
<p>All</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="item__2d_2denable_2deverything">--enable-everything</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
Add (or remove) support for all non-multichoice options listed in ``./configure
--help''.
</dd>
<dd>
<p>You can specify this and then disable options you do not like by
<em>following</em> this with the appropriate <code>--disable-...</code> arguments,
or you can start with a minimal configuration by specifying
<code>--disable-everything</code> and than adding just the <code>--enable-...</code> arguments
you want.</p>
</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_xft">--enable-xft (default: enabled)</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
Add support for Xft (anti-aliases, among others) fonts. Xft fonts are
slower and require lots of memory, but as long as you don't use them, you
don't pay for them.
</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_styles">--enable-font-styles (default: on)</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
Add support for <strong>bold</strong>, <em>italic</em> and <strong><em>bold italic</em> </strong>&gt; font
styles. The fonts can be set manually or automatically.
</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item__2d_2dwith_2dcodesets_3dname_2c_2e_2e_2e__28defaul">--with-codesets=NAME,... (default: all)</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
Compile in support for additional codeset (encoding) groups (<code>eu</code>, <code>vn</code>
are always compiled in, which includes most 8-bit character sets). These
codeset tables are used for driving X11 core fonts, they are not required
for Xft fonts, although having them compiled in lets rxvt-unicode choose
replacement fonts more intelligently. Compiling them in will make your
binary bigger (all of together cost about 700kB), but it doesn't increase
memory usage unless you use a font requiring one of these encodings.
</dd>
<table>

<tr><td>kr</td><td>korean encodings</td></tr>
</table><p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_xim">--enable-xim (default: on)</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
Add support for XIM (X Input Method) protocol. This allows using
alternative input methods (e.g. kinput2) and will also correctly
set up the input for people using dead keys or compose keys.
</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_unicode3">--enable-unicode3 (default: off)</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
Recommended to stay off unless you really need non-BMP characters.
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Enable direct support for displaying unicode codepoints above
65535 (the basic multilingual page). This increases storage
requirements per character from 2 to 4 bytes. X11 fonts do not yet
support these extra characters, but Xft does.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Please note that rxvt-unicode can store unicode code points &gt;65535
even without this flag, but the number of such characters is
limited to a view thousand (shared with combining characters,
see next switch), and right now rxvt-unicode cannot display them
(input/output and cut&amp;paste still work, though).</p>
</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_combining">--enable-combining (default: on)</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
Enable automatic composition of combining characters into
composite characters. This is required for proper viewing of text
where accents are encoded as seperate unicode characters. This is
done by using precomposited characters when available or creating
new pseudo-characters when no precomposed form exists.
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Without --enable-unicode3, the number of additional precomposed
characters is somewhat limited (the 6400 private use characters will be
(ab-)used). With --enable-unicode3, no practical limit exists.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>This option will also enable storage (but not display) of characters
beyond plane 0 (&gt;65535) when --enable-unicode3 was not specified.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>The combining table also contains entries for arabic presentation forms,
but these are not currently used. Bug me if you want these to be used (and
tell me how these are to be used...).</p>
</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_fallback">--enable-fallback(=CLASS) (default: Rxvt)</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
When reading resource settings, also read settings for class CLASS. To
disable resource fallback use --disable-fallback.
</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_name">--with-res-name=NAME (default: urxvt)</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
Use the given name as default application name when
reading resources. Specify --with-res-name=rxvt to replace rxvt.
</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item__2d_2dwith_2dres_2dclass_3dclass__2fdefault_3a_urx">--with-res-class=CLASS /default: URxvt)</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
Use the given class as default application class
when reading resources. Specify --with-res-class=Rxvt to replace
rxvt.
</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_utmp">--enable-utmp (default: on)</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
Write user and tty to utmp file (used by programs like <em>w</em>) at
start of rxvt execution and delete information when rxvt exits.
</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_wtmp">--enable-wtmp (default: on)</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
Write user and tty to wtmp file (used by programs like <em>last</em>) at
start of rxvt execution and write logout when rxvt exits.  This
option requires --enable-utmp to also be specified.
</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_lastlog">--enable-lastlog (default: on)</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
Write user and tty to lastlog file (used by programs like
<em>lastlogin</em>) at start of rxvt execution.  This option requires
--enable-utmp to also be specified.
</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_background">--enable-xpm-background (default: on)</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
Add support for XPM background pixmaps.
</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_transparency">--enable-transparency (default: on)</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
Add support for inheriting parent backgrounds thus giving a fake
transparency to the term.
</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_fading">--enable-fading (default: on)</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
Add support for fading the text when focus is lost (requires <code>--enable-transparency</code>).
</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_tinting">--enable-tinting (default: on)</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
Add support for tinting of transparent backgrounds (requires <code>--enable-transparency</code>).
</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_scroll">--enable-rxvt-scroll (default: on)</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
Add support for the original rxvt scrollbar.
</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong>--enable-next-scroll (default: on)</strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
Add support for a NeXT-like scrollbar.

<p></p>
<dt><strong>--enable-plain-scroll (default: on)</strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
Add support for a very unobtrusive, plain-looking scrollbar that
is the favourite of the rxvt-unicode author, having used it for
many years.
</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_ttygid">--enable-ttygid (default: off)</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
Change tty device setting to group ``tty'' - only use this if
your system uses this type of security.
</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item__2d_2ddisable_2dbackspace_2dkey">--disable-backspace-key</a></strong><br />

<dt><strong><a name="item_frills">--enable-frills (default: on)</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
Add support for many small features that are not essential but nice to
have. Normally you want this, but for very small binaries you may want to
disable this.
</dd>
<dd>
