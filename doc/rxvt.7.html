</dt>
<dd>
The Debian GNU/Linux package of rxvt-unicode in sarge contains large
patches that considerably change the behaviour of rxvt-unicode. Before
reporting a bug to the original rxvt-unicode author please download and
install the genuine version (<a href="http://software.schmorp.de#rxvt-unicode">http://software.schmorp.de#rxvt-unicode</a>)
and try to reproduce the problem. If you cannot, chances are that the
problems are specific to Debian GNU/Linux, in which case it should be
reported via the Debian Bug Tracking System (use <code>reportbug</code> to report
the bug).
</dd>
<dd>
<p>For other problems that also affect the Debian package, you can and
probably should use the Debian BTS, too, because, after all, it's also a
bug in the Debian version and it serves as a reminder for other users that
might encounter the same issue.</p>
</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_when_i_log_2din_to_another_system_it_tells_me_abou">When I log-in to another system it tells me about missing terminfo data?</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
The terminal description used by rxvt-unicode is not as widely available
as that for xterm, or even rxvt (for which the same problem often arises).
</dd>
<dd>
<p>The correct solution for this problem is to install the terminfo, this can
be done like this (with ncurses' infocmp):</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
   REMOTE=remotesystem.domain
   infocmp rxvt-unicode | ssh $REMOTE &quot;cat &gt;/tmp/ti &amp;&amp; tic /tmp/ti&quot;</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>... or by installing rxvt-unicode normally on the remote system,</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>If you cannot or do not want to do this, then you can simply set
<code>TERM=rxvt</code> or even <code>TERM=xterm</code>, and live with the small number of
problems arising, which includes wrong keymapping, less and different
colours and some refresh errors in fullscreen applications. It's a nice
quick-and-dirty workaround for rare cases, though.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>If you always want to do this (and are fine with the consequences) you
can either recompile rxvt-unicode with the desired TERM value or use a
resource to set it:</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
   URxvt.termName: rxvt</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>If you don't plan to use <strong>rxvt</strong> (quite common...) you could also replace
the rxvt terminfo file with the rxvt-unicode one.</p>
</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_tic_outputs_some_error_when_compiling_the_terminfo"><code>tic</code> outputs some error when compiling the terminfo entry.</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
Most likely it's the empty definition for <code>enacs=</code>. Just replace it by
<code>enacs=\E[0@</code> and try again.
</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_bash_27s_readline_does_not_work_correctly_under_rx"><code>bash</code>'s readline does not work correctly under rxvt.</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dt><strong><a name="item_i_need_a_termcap_file_entry_2e">I need a termcap file entry.</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
One reason you might want this is that some distributions or operating
systems still compile some programs using the long-obsoleted termcap
library (Fedora Core's bash is one example) and rely on a termcap entry
for <code>rxvt-unicode</code>.
</dd>
<dd>
<p>You could use rxvt's termcap entry with resonable results in many cases.
You can also create a termcap entry by using terminfo's infocmp program
like this:</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
   infocmp -C rxvt-unicode</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Or you could use this termcap entry, generated by the command above:</p>

</dt>
<dd>
The <code>ls</code> in the GNU coreutils unfortunately doesn't use terminfo to
decide wether a terminal has colour, but uses it's own configuration
file. Needless to say, <code>rxvt-unicode</code> is not in it's default file (among
with most other terminals supporting colour). Either add:
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
   TERM rxvt-unicode</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>to <code>/etc/DIR_COLORS</code> or simply add:</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
   alias ls='ls --color=auto'</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>to your <code>.profile</code> or <code>.bashrc</code>.</p>

<dd>
Make sure you are using <code>TERM=rxvt-unicode</code>. Some pre-packaged
distributions (most notably Debian GNU/Linux) break rxvt-unicode
by setting <code>TERM</code> to <code>rxvt</code>, which doesn't have these extra
features. Unfortunately, some of these (most notably, again, Debian
GNU/Linux) furthermore fail to even install the <code>rxvt-unicode</code> terminfo
file, so you will need to install it on your own (See the question <strong>When
I log-in to another system it tells me about missing terminfo data?</strong> on
how to do this).

</dt>
<dd>
Some Debian GNUL/Linux users seem to have this problem, although no
specific details were reported so far. It is possible that this is caused
by the wrong <code>TERM</code> setting, although the details of wether and how
this can happen are unknown, as <code>TERM=rxvt</code> should offer a compatible
keymap. See the answer to the previous question, and please report if that
helped.

<dd>
If you encounter strange problems like typing an accented character but
getting two unrelated other characters or similar, or if program output is
subtly garbled, then you should check your locale settings.
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Rxvt-unicode must be started with the same <code>LC_CTYPE</code> setting as the
programs. Often rxvt-unicode is started in the <a href="#item_c"><code>C</code></a> locale, while the
login script running within the rxvt-unicode window changes the locale to
something else, e.g. <code>en_GB.UTF-8</code>. Needless to say, this is not going to work.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>The best thing is to fix your startup environment, as you will likely run
into other problems. If nothing works you can try this in your .profile.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
  printf '\e]701;%s\007' &quot;$LC_CTYPE&quot;</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>If this doesn't work, then maybe you use a <code>LC_CTYPE</code> specification not
supported on your systems. Some systems have a <code>locale</code> command which
displays this (also, <code>perl -e0</code> can be used to check locale settings, as
it will complain loudly if it cannot set the locale). If it displays something
like:</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
  locale: Cannot set LC_CTYPE to default locale: ...</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Then the locale you specified is not supported on your system.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>If nothing works and you are sure that everything is set correctly then
you will need to remember a little known fact: Some programs just don't
support locales :(</p>
</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_why_do_some_characters_look_so_much_different_than">Why do some characters look so much different than others?</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dt><strong><a name="item_how_does_rxvt_2dunicode_choose_fonts_3f">How does rxvt-unicode choose fonts?</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
Most fonts do not contain the full range of Unicode, which is
fine. Chances are that the font you (or the admin/package maintainer of
your system/os) have specified does not cover all the characters you want
to display.
</dd>
<dd>
<p><strong>rxvt-unicode</strong> makes a best-effort try at finding a replacement
font. Often the result is fine, but sometimes the chosen font looks
bad/ugly/wrong. Some fonts have totally strange characters that don't
resemble the correct glyph at all, and rxvt-unicode lacks the artificial
intelligence to detect that a specific glyph is wrong: it has to believe
the font that the characters it claims to contain indeed look correct.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>In that case, select a font of your taste and add it to the font list,
e.g.:</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
   rxvt -fn basefont,font2,font3...</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>When rxvt-unicode sees a character, it will first look at the base
font. If the base font does not contain the character, it will go to the
next font, and so on. Specifying your own fonts will also speed up this
search and use less resources within rxvt-unicode and the X-server.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>The only limitation is that none of the fonts may be larger than the base
font, as the base font defines the terminal character cell size, which
must be the same due to the way terminals work.</p>
</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_why_do_some_chinese_characters_look_so_different_t">Why do some chinese characters look so different than others?</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
This is because there is a difference between script and language --
rxvt-unicode does not know which language the text that is output is,
as it only knows the unicode character codes. If rxvt-unicode first
sees a japanese/chinese character, it might choose a japanese font for
display. Subsequent japanese characters will use that font. Now, many
chinese characters aren't represented in japanese fonts, so when the first
non-japanese character comes up, rxvt-unicode will look for a chinese font
-- unfortunately at this point, it will still use the japanese font for
chinese characters that are also in the japanese font.
</dd>
<dd>
<p>The workaround is easy: just tag a chinese font at the end of your font
list (see the previous question). The key is to view the font list as
a preference list: If you expect more japanese, list a japanese font
first. If you expect more chinese, put a chinese font first.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>In the future it might be possible to switch language preferences at
runtime (the internal data structure has no problem with using different
fonts for the same character at the same time, but no interface for this
has been designed yet).</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Until then, you might get away with switching fonts at runtime (see <a href="#can_i_switch_the_fonts_at_runtime">Can I switch the fonts at runtime?</a> later in this document).</p>
</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_why_does_rxvt_2dunicode_sometimes_leave_pixel_drop">Why does rxvt-unicode sometimes leave pixel droppings?</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
Most fonts were not designed for terminal use, which means that character
size varies a lot. A font that is otherwise fine for terminal use might
contain some characters that are simply too wide. Rxvt-unicode will avoid
these characters. For characters that are just ``a bit'' too wide a special
``careful'' rendering mode is used that redraws adjacent characters.
</dd>
<dd>
<p>All of this requires that fonts do not lie about character sizes,
however: Xft fonts often draw glyphs larger than their acclaimed bounding
box, and rxvt-unicode has no way of detecting this (the correct way is to
ask for the character bounding box, which unfortunately is wrong in these
cases).</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>It's not clear (to me at least), wether this is a bug in Xft, freetype,
or the respective font. If you encounter this problem you might try using
the <code>-lsp</code> option to give the font more height. If that doesn't work, you
might be forced to use a different font.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>All of this is not a problem when using X11 core fonts, as their bounding
box data is correct.</p>
</dd>

<dt><strong><a name="item_on_solaris_9_2c_many_line_2ddrawing_characters_are">On Solaris 9, many line-drawing characters are too wide.</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
Seems to be a known bug, read
<a href="http://nixdoc.net/files/forum/about34198.html">http://nixdoc.net/files/forum/about34198.html</a>. Some people use the
following ugly workaround to get non-double-wide-characters working:
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
   #define wcwidth(x) wcwidth(x) &gt; 1 ? 1 : wcwidth(x)</pre>
</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_compose">My Compose (Multi_key) key is no longer working.</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
The most common causes for this are that either your locale is not set
correctly, or you specified a <strong>preeditStyle</strong> that is not supported by
your input method. For example, if you specified <strong>OverTheSpot</strong> and
your input method (e.g. the default input method handling Compose keys)
does not support this (for instance because it is not visual), then
rxvt-unicode will continue without an input method.
</dd>
<dd>
<p>In this case either do not specify a <strong>preeditStyle</strong> or specify more than
one pre-edit style, such as <strong>OverTheSpot,Root,None</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_i_cannot_type_ctrl_2dshift_2d2_to_get_an_ascii_nul">I cannot type <code>Ctrl-Shift-2</code> to get an ASCII NUL character due to ISO 14755</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
Either try <code>Ctrl-2</code> alone (it often is mapped to ASCII NUL even on
international keyboards) or simply use ISO 14755 support to your
advantage, typing &lt;Ctrl-Shift-0&gt; to get a ASCII NUL. This works for other
codes, too, such as <code>Ctrl-Shift-1-d</code> to type the default telnet escape
character and so on.
</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_how_can_i_keep_rxvt_2dunicode_from_using_reverse_v">How can I keep rxvt-unicode from using reverse video so much?</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
First of all, make sure you are running with the right terminal settings
(<code>TERM=rxvt-unicode</code>), which will get rid of most of these effects. Then
make sure you have specified colours for italic and bold, as otherwise
rxvt-unicode might use reverse video to simulate the effect:
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
   URxvt.colorBD:  white
   URxvt.colorIT:  green</pre>
</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_colours">Some programs assume totally weird colours (red instead of blue), how can I fix that?</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
For some unexplainable reason, some rare programs assume a very weird
colour palette when confronted with a terminal with more than the standard
8 colours (rxvt-unicode supports 88). The right fix is, of course, to fix
these programs not to assume non-ISO colours without very good reasons.
</dd>
<dd>
<p>In the meantime, you can either edit your <code>rxvt-unicode</code> terminfo
definition to only claim 8 colour support or use <code>TERM=rxvt</code>, which will
fix colours but keep you from using other rxvt-unicode features.</p>
</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_i_am_on_freebsd_and_rxvt_2dunicode_does_not_seem_t">I am on FreeBSD and rxvt-unicode does not seem to work at all.</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
Rxvt-unicode requires the symbol <code>__STDC_ISO_10646__</code> to be defined
in your compile environment, or an implementation that implements it,
wether it defines the symbol or not. <code>__STDC_ISO_10646__</code> requires that
<strong>wchar_t</strong> is represented as unicode.
</dd>
<dd>
<p>As you might have guessed, FreeBSD does neither define this symobl nor
does it support it. Instead, it uses it's own internal representation of
<strong>wchar_t</strong>. This is, of course, completely fine with respect to standards.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>However, that means rxvt-unicode only works in <code>POSIX</code>, <code>ISO-8859-1</code> and
<code>UTF-8</code> locales under FreeBSD (which all use Unicode as <strong>wchar_t</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p><code>__STDC_ISO_10646__</code> is the only sane way to support multi-language
apps in an OS, as using a locale-dependent (and non-standardized)
representation of <strong>wchar_t</strong> makes it impossible to convert between
<strong>wchar_t</strong> (as used by X11 and your applications) and any other encoding
without implementing OS-specific-wrappers for each and every locale. There
simply are no APIs to convert <strong>wchar_t</strong> into anything except the current
locale encoding.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Some applications (such as the formidable <strong>mlterm</strong>) work around this
by carrying their own replacement functions for character set handling
with them, and either implementing OS-dependent hacks or doing multiple
conversions (which is slow and unreliable in case the OS implements
encodings slightly different than the terminal emulator).</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>The rxvt-unicode author insists that the right way to fix this is in the
system libraries once and for all, instead of forcing every app to carry
complete replacements for them :)</p>

<dd>
rxvt-unicode should compile and run out of the box on cygwin, using
the X11 libraries that come with cygwin. libW11 emulation is no
longer supported (and makes no sense, either, as it only supported a
single font). I recommend starting the X-server in <code>-multiwindow</code> or
<code>-rootless</code> mode instead, which will result in similar look&amp;feel as the
old libW11 emulation.
</dd>
<dd>
<p>At the time of this writing, cygwin didn't seem to support any multi-byte
encodings (you might try <code>LC_CTYPE=C-UTF-8</code>), so you are likely limited
to 8-bit encodings.</p>

specific ``utf-8'' mode, such as xterm. In fact, it doesn't even know about
UTF-8 or any other encodings with respect to terminal I/O.
</dd>
<dd>
<p>The reasons is that there exists a perfectly fine mechanism for selecting
the encoding, doing I/O and (most important) communicating this to all
applications so everybody agrees on character properties such as width
and code number. This mechanism is the <em>locale</em>. Applications not using
that info will have problems (for example, <code>xterm</code> gets the width of
characters wrong as it uses it's own, locale-independent table under all
locales).</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Rxvt-unicode uses the <code>LC_CTYPE</code> locale category to select encoding. All
programs doing the same (that is, most) will automatically agree in the
interpretation of characters.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no system-independent way to select locales, nor
is there a standard on how locale specifiers will look like.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>On most systems, the content of the <code>LC_CTYPE</code> environment variable
contains an arbitrary string which corresponds to an already-installed
locale. Common names for locales are <code>en_US.UTF-8</code>, <code>de_DE.ISO-8859-15</code>,
<code>ja_JP.EUC-JP</code>, i.e. <code>language_country.encoding</code>, but other forms
(i.e. <code>de</code> or <code>german</code>) are also common.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Rxvt-unicode ignores all other locale categories, and except for
the encoding, ignores country or language-specific settings,
i.e. <code>de_DE.UTF-8</code> and <code>ja_JP.UTF-8</code> are the normally same to
rxvt-unicode.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>If you want to use a specific encoding you have to make sure you start
rxvt-unicode with the correct <code>LC_CTYPE</code> category.</p>
</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_can_i_switch_locales_at_runtime_3f">Can I switch locales at runtime?</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
Yes, using an escape sequence. Try something like this, which sets
rxvt-unicode's idea of <code>LC_CTYPE</code>.
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
  printf '\e]701;%s\007' ja_JP.SJIS</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>See also the previous answer.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Sometimes this capability is rather handy when you want to work in
one locale (e.g. <code>de_DE.UTF-8</code>) but some programs don't support it
(e.g. UTF-8). For example, I use this script to start <code>xjdic</code>, which
first switches to a locale supported by xjdic and back later:</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
   printf '\e]701;%s\007' ja_JP.SJIS
   xjdic -js
   printf '\e]701;%s\007' de_DE.UTF-8</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>You can also use xterm's <code>luit</code> program, which usually works fine, except
for some locales where character width differs between program- and
rxvt-unicode-locales.</p>
</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_can_i_switch_the_fonts_at_runtime_3f">Can I switch the fonts at runtime?</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
Yes, using an escape sequence. Try something like this, which has the same
effect as using the <code>-fn</code> switch, and takes effect immediately:
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
   printf '\e]50;%s\007' &quot;9x15bold,xft:Kochi Gothic&quot;</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>This is useful if you e.g. work primarily with japanese (and prefer a
japanese font), but you have to switch to chinese temporarily, where
japanese fonts would only be in your way.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>You can think of this as a kind of manual ISO-2022 switching.</p>

<dt><strong><a name="item_why_do_italic_characters_look_as_if_clipped_3f">Why do italic characters look as if clipped?</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
Many fonts have difficulties with italic characters and hinting. For
example, the otherwise very nicely hinted font <code>xft:Bitstream Vera Sans
Mono</code> completely fails in it's italic face. A workaround might be to
enable freetype autohinting, i.e. like this:
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
   URxvt.italicFont:        xft:Bitstream Vera Sans Mono:italic:autohint=true
   URxvt.boldItalicFont:    xft:Bitstream Vera Sans Mono:bold:italic:autohint=true</pre>
</dd>

<dt><strong><a name="item_my_input_method_wants__3csome_encoding_3e_but_i_wa">My input method wants &lt;some encoding&gt; but I want UTF-8, what can I do?</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
You can specify separate locales for the input method and the rest of the
terminal, using the resource <code>imlocale</code>:
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
   URxvt*imlocale: ja_JP.EUC-JP</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Now you can start your terminal with <code>LC_CTYPE=ja_JP.UTF-8</code> and still
use your input method. Please note, however, that you will not be able to
input characters outside <code>EUC-JP</code> in a normal way then, as your input
method limits you.</p>
</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_rxvt_2dunicode_crashes_when_the_x_input_method_cha">Rxvt-unicode crashes when the X Input Method changes or exits.</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
Unfortunately, this is unavoidable, as the XIM protocol is racy by
design. Applications can avoid some crashes at the expense of memory
leaks, and Input Methods can avoid some crashes by careful ordering at
exit time. <strong>kinput2</strong> (and derived input methods) generally succeeds,
while <strong>SCIM</strong> (or similar input methods) fails. In the end, however,
crashes cannot be completely avoided even if both sides cooperate.
</dd>
<dd>
<p>So the only workaround is not to kill your Input Method Servers.</p>

<dt><strong><a name="item_rxvt_2dunicode_uses_gobs_of_memory_2c_how_can_i_re">Rxvt-unicode uses gobs of memory, how can I reduce that?</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
Rxvt-unicode tries to obey the rule of not charging you for something you
don't use. One thing you should try is to configure out all settings that
you don't need, for example, Xft support is a resource hog by design,
when used. Compiling it out ensures that no Xft font will be loaded
accidentally when rxvt-unicode tries to find a font for your characters.
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Also, many people (me included) like large windows and even larger
scrollback buffers: Without <code>--enable-unicode3</code>, rxvt-unicode will use
6 bytes per screen cell. For a 160x?? window this amounts to almost a
kilobyte per line. A scrollback buffer of 10000 lines will then (if full)
use 10 Megabytes of memory. With <code>--enable-unicode3</code> it gets worse, as
rxvt-unicode then uses 8 bytes per screen cell.</p>

<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_can_i_speed_up_xft_rendering_somehow_3f">Can I speed up Xft rendering somehow?</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
Yes, the most obvious way to speed it up is to avoid Xft entirely, as
it is simply slow. If you still want Xft fonts you might try to disable
antialiasing (by appending <code>:antialias=false</code>), which saves lots of
memory and also speeds up rendering considerably.
</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_rxvt_2dunicode_doesn_27t_seem_to_anti_2dalias_its_">Rxvt-unicode doesn't seem to anti-alias its fonts, what is wrong?</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
Rxvt-unicode will use whatever you specify as a font. If it needs to
fall back to it's default font search list it will prefer X11 core
fonts, because they are small and fast, and then use Xft fonts. It has
antialiasing disabled for most of them, because the author thinks they
look best that way.
</dd>

<p>If you want antialiasing, you have to specify the fonts manually.</p>

</dt>
<dd>
Assuming that the physical Backspace key corresponds to the
BackSpace keysym (not likely for Linux ... see the following
question) there are two standard values that can be used for
Backspace: <code>^H</code> and <code>^?</code>.
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Historically, either value is correct, but rxvt-unicode adopts the debian
policy of using <code>^?</code> when unsure, because it's the one only only correct
choice :).</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Rxvt-unicode tries to inherit the current stty settings and uses the value
of `erase' to guess the value for backspace.  If rxvt-unicode wasn't
started from a terminal (say, from a menu or by remote shell), then the
system value of `erase', which corresponds to CERASE in &lt;termios.h&gt;, will
be used (which may not be the same as your stty setting).</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>For starting a new rxvt-unicode:</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
   # use Backspace = ^H
   $ stty erase ^H
   $ rxvt</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
   # use Backspace = ^?
   $ stty erase ^?
   $ rxvt</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Toggle with <code>ESC [ 36 h</code> / <code>ESC [ 36 l</code> as documented in rxvt(7).</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>For an existing rxvt-unicode:</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
   # use Backspace = ^H
   $ stty erase ^H
   $ echo -n &quot;^[[36h&quot;</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
   # use Backspace = ^?
   $ stty erase ^?
   $ echo -n &quot;^[[36l&quot;</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>This helps satisfy some of the Backspace discrepancies that occur, but
if you use Backspace = <code>^H</code>, make sure that the termcap/terminfo value
properly reflects that.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>The Delete key is a another casualty of the ill-defined Backspace problem.
To avoid confusion between the Backspace and Delete keys, the Delete
key has been assigned an escape sequence to match the vt100 for Execute
(<code>ESC [ 3 ~</code>) and is in the supplied termcap/terminfo.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Some other Backspace problems:</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>some editors use termcap/terminfo,
some editors (vim I'm told) expect Backspace = ^H,
GNU Emacs (and Emacs-like editors) use ^H for help.</p>

<p>Perhaps someday this will all be resolved in a consistent manner.</p>

<h1><a name="menubar">menuBar</a></h1>
<p><strong>The exact syntax used is <em>almost</em> solidified. </strong>&gt;
In the menus, <strong>DON'T</strong> try to use menuBar commands that add or remove a
menuBar.</p>
<p>Note that in all of the commands, the <strong><em>/path/</em> </strong>&gt; <em>cannot</em> be
omitted: use <strong>./</strong> to specify a menu relative to the current menu.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="overview_of_menubar_operation">Overview of menuBar operation</a></h2>
<p>For the menuBar XTerm escape sequence <code>ESC ] 703 ; Pt ST</code>, the syntax
of <a href="#item_pt"><code>Pt</code></a> can be used for a variety of tasks:</p>
<p>At the top level is the current menuBar which is a member of a circular
linked-list of other such menuBars.</p>
<p>The menuBar acts as a parent for the various drop-down menus, which in
turn, may have labels, separator lines, menuItems and subMenus.</p>
<p>The menuItems are the useful bits: you can use them to mimic keyboard
input or even to send text or escape sequences back to rxvt.</p>
<p>The menuBar syntax is intended to provide a simple yet robust method of
constructing and manipulating menus and navigating through the
menuBars.</p>
<p>The first step is to use the tag <strong>[menu:<em>name</em>] </strong>&gt; which creates
the menuBar called <em>name</em> and allows access. You may now or menus,
subMenus, and menuItems. Finally, use the tag <strong>[done]</strong> to set the
menuBar access as <strong>readonly</strong> to prevent accidental corruption of the
menus. To re-access the current menuBar for alterations, use the tag
<strong>[menu]</strong>, make the alterations and then use <strong>[done]</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>

<h1><a name="configure_options">CONFIGURE OPTIONS</a></h1>
<p>General hint: if you get compile errors, then likely your configuration
hasn't been tested well. Either try with <a href="#item__2d_2denable_2deverything"><code>--enable-everything</code></a> or use
the <em>./reconf</em> script as a base for experiments. <em>./reconf</em> is used by
myself, so it should generally be a working config. Of course, you should
always report when a combination doesn't work, so it can be fixed. Marc
Lehmann &lt;<a href="mailto:rxvt@schmorp.de">rxvt@schmorp.de</a>&gt;.</p>
<p>All</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="item__2d_2denable_2deverything">--enable-everything</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
Add (or remove) support for all non-multichoice options listed in ``./configure
--help''.
</dd>
<dd>
<p>You can specify this and then disable options you do not like by
<em>following</em> this with the appropriate <code>--disable-...</code> arguments,
or you can start with a minimal configuration by specifying
<code>--disable-everything</code> and than adding just the <code>--enable-...</code> arguments
you want.</p>
</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_xft">--enable-xft (default: enabled)</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
Add support for Xft (anti-aliases, among others) fonts. Xft fonts are
slower and require lots of memory, but as long as you don't use them, you
don't pay for them.
</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_styles">--enable-font-styles (default: on)</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
Add support for <strong>bold</strong>, <em>italic</em> and <strong><em>bold italic</em> </strong>&gt; font
styles. The fonts can be set manually or automatically.
</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item__2d_2dwith_2dcodesets_3dname_2c_2e_2e_2e__28defaul">--with-codesets=NAME,... (default: all)</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
Compile in support for additional codeset (encoding) groups (<code>eu</code>, <code>vn</code>
are always compiled in, which includes most 8-bit character sets). These
codeset tables are used for driving X11 core fonts, they are not required
for Xft fonts, although having them compiled in lets rxvt-unicode choose
replacement fonts more intelligently. Compiling them in will make your
binary bigger (all of together cost about 700kB), but it doesn't increase
memory usage unless you use a font requiring one of these encodings.

</table><p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_xim">--enable-xim (default: on)</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
Add support for XIM (X Input Method) protocol. This allows using
alternative input methods (e.g. kinput2) and will also correctly
set up the input for people using dead keys or compose keys.
</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_unicode3">--enable-unicode3 (default: off)</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
Enable direct support for displaying unicode codepoints above
65535 (the basic multilingual page). This increases storage
requirements per character from 2 to 4 bytes. X11 fonts do not yet
support these extra characters, but Xft does.
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Please note that rxvt-unicode can store unicode code points &gt;65535
even without this flag, but the number of such characters is
limited to a view thousand (shared with combining characters,
see next switch), and right now rxvt-unicode cannot display them
(input/output and cut&amp;paste still work, though).</p>
</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_combining">--enable-combining (default: on)</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
Enable automatic composition of combining characters into
composite characters. This is required for proper viewing of text
where accents are encoded as seperate unicode characters. This is
done by using precomposited characters when available or creating
new pseudo-characters when no precomposed form exists.
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Without --enable-unicode3, the number of additional precomposed characters
is rather limited (2048, if this is full, rxvt-unicode will use the
private use area, extending the number of combinations to 8448). With
--enable-unicode3, no practical limit exists.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>This option will also enable storage (but not display) of characters
beyond plane 0 (&gt;65535) when --enable-unicode3 was not specified.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>The combining table also contains entries for arabic presentation forms,
but these are not currently used. Bug me if you want these to be used (and
tell me how these are to be used...).</p>
</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_fallback">--enable-fallback(=CLASS) (default: Rxvt)</a></strong><br />

</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_name">--with-res-name=NAME (default: urxvt)</a></strong><br />

</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_wtmp">--enable-wtmp (default: on)</a></strong><br />
</dt>

Write user and tty to wtmp file (used by programs like <em>last</em>) at

option requires --enable-utmp to also be specified.
</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_lastlog">--enable-lastlog (default: on)</a></strong><br />

transparency to the term.
</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_fading">--enable-fading (default: on)</a></strong><br />

</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_tinting">--enable-tinting (default: on)</a></strong><br />

<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_menubar">--enable-menubar (default: off)</a></strong><br />

</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_shadow">--enable-half-shadow (default: off)</a></strong><br />

Make resources checking via <code>XGetDefault()</code> instead of our small

~/.Xresources.
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Please note that nowadays, things like XIM will automatically pull in and

small, if nonexistant.</p>

Add support for our possibly faster <code>memset()</code> function and other
